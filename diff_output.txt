-Eric Theodore Cartman
-, commonly referred to as just
-Cartman
-,
-[
-1
-]
-is a fictional character in the
-adult
-animated sitcom
-South Park
-, created by
-Trey Parker
-and
-Matt Stone
-. He is voiced by Parker, and is one of the series' four main characters, alongside
-Stan Marsh
-,
-Kyle Broflovski
-, and
-Kenny McCormick
-. He first appeared with the name Kenny in the short film
-The Spirit of Christmas
-(1992), and later appeared in the 1995 film of the same title before debuting in "
-Cartman Gets an Anal Probe
-", the first episode of the series, on August 13, 1997.
-Cartman is an elementary school student who lives with his single mother,
-Liane
-, in the eponymous
-Colorado
-town. Cartman is principally characterized by his obesity, his amorality, and his bigoted and especially
-antisemitic
-disposition, being described by Parker and Stone as "a little
-Archie Bunker
-". In later seasons, particularly following the
-fifth season
-episode "
-Scott Tenorman Must Die
-" (in which he turns the titular Scott Tenorman's parents into chili, in order to feed it to him as revenge for bullying him), Cartman exhibits increasingly
-psychopathic
-and
-manipulative
-behavior. The latter is showcased through Cartman's various schemes, the majority of which fail either due to opposition from other characters or Cartman's own
-hubris
-, frequently leaving Cartman in complete humiliation.
-Cartman is widely considered to be the most popular
-South Park
-character, one of the most influential fictional characters of all time, and an American cultural icon.
-[
-2
-]
-[
-3
-]
-[
-4
-]
-Parker and Stone have stated that he is their favorite character, and the one with whom they most identify.
-South Park
-has received both praise and criticism for Cartman's
-politically incorrect
-behavior.
-Role in
-South Park
-Cartman attends South Park Elementary as part of
-Mr. Garrison
-'s class. During the first 58 episodes, he and his classmates were in the third grade, before transitioning to the fourth grade during the fourth season. He is the
-only child
-of
-Liane Cartman
-, a promiscuous single mother. In the episode "
-Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut
-", Liane is said to be
-intersex
-, being both Eric's mother and father.
-[
-5
-]
-This is later revealed to be an elaborate ruse in the fourteenth-season episode "
-200
-". In the following episode, "
-201
-", it is revealed that Cartman's true biological father is Jack Tenorman, a former player for the
-Denver Broncos
-whom he arranged to have killed in "
-Scott Tenorman Must Die
-"; Scott Tenorman, Jack's son, is thus revealed to be Cartman's half-brother.
-[
-6
-]
-Cartman is distinguished from most of the other children by a wider physical appearance,
-[
-7
-]
-and is subject to ridicule from others for his obesity.
-[
-8
-]
-He is most commonly portrayed as an antagonist, with most of his actions driving the events of many episodes.
-[
-9
-]
-Cartman is alienated by the majority of the other children for his strong amorality,
-[
-10
-]
-[
-11
-]
-[
-12
-]
-[
-13
-]
-[
-14
-]
-but they are occasionally influenced by his manipulation.
-[
-15
-]
-Though Cartman has shared an enmity with all three of his friends, his rivalry with Stan and Kyle has progressed significantly during the show's run, with Cartman routinely exposing them to physical endangerment. Cartman, a staunch
-antisemite
-, reflects most of his hatred towards the
-Jewish
-Kyle, such as deliberately infecting him with
-HIV
-("
-Tonsil Trouble
-").
-[
-7
-]
-[
-16
-]
-Kyle occasionally exhibits similar behavior in such episodes as "
-Fatbeard
-", wherein Kyle
-encourages Cartman to travel to
-Somalia
-, hoping he will be killed.
-[
-17
-]
-His rivalry with the other characters stems from opposition with their personalities. Where Kyle is restrained by firm morals, Cartman indulges in sadistic hedonism. He revealed that he hated Kenny the most in the episode "
-Jakovasaurs
-". He has on numerous occasions made fun of Kenny for being
-poor
-.
-[
-18
-]
-In "
-Kenny Dies
-", Cartman takes advantage of his declining health to get a ban on stem cell research lifted in order to construct his own
-Shakey's Pizza
-restaurant out of fetus stem cells. However, Cartman also implies that Kenny is his best friend, making their relationship unclear.
-[
-19
-]
-[
-20
-]
-Kyle is sometimes an enthusiastic participant in Cartman's schemes and he is sometimes seen treating Kyle well, although this is generally to put aside their hatred momentarily for a common goal or for manipulation.
-[
-21
-]
-Parker and Stone have compared the relationship to that between
-Archie Bunker
-and
-Michael Stivic
-on
-All in the Family
-. Kyle has a tendency to make what he thinks are safe bets with Cartman, often losing these bets when the improbable actions promised by Cartman are accomplished. Cartman's motivation in this regard is not only monetary gain, but an obsession with beating Kyle, a fixation that ultimately plays a major part in a subplot to the three-part "
-Imaginationland
-".
-[
-7
-]
-This obsession has been shown to overshadow other goals Cartman wishes to achieve. Cartman has a high sadistic streak towards Kyle, and has repeatedly expressed desire in seeing him suffer,
-[
-22
-]
-often to extremes.
-[
-23
-]
-In "
-You're Getting Old
-", it is suggested that Kyle and Cartman may be developing a genuine friendship, possibly due to the void left by Stan's apparent departure. This relationship ends in "
-Ass Burgers
-", however, due to Kyle finding out how Cartman was producing his hamburgers. Cartman's resentment of Stan is at times reserved for when Cartman actively proclaims his hatred for both Stan and Kyle as a duo, and his contempt for Stan as an individual is usually due to his annoyance with Stan's sensitivity, affection for animals, and relationship with
-Wendy Testaburger
-.
-[
-24
-]
-Despite being intolerant of other cultures, Cartman displays an aptitude for learning foreign languages. He knows
-German
-, and once uses this knowledge to impersonate
-Adolf Hitler
-while promoting the extermination of Jews to an oblivious audience that did not speak German,
-[
-25
-]
-and in interactions with Mexican laborers, such as the episode "
-My Future Self n' Me
-", seems to speak at least conversational
-Spanish
-.
-[
-26
-]
-This is in service of a running joke in which Cartman displays incredible aptitude at quickly learning almost any topic in service of his schemes, despite being an awful student in a school environment and displaying extreme ignorance about subjects that do not immediately interest him.
-Conversely, in "
-Major Boobage
-", Cartman shelters the town's cats when they are outlawed;
-[
-27
-]
-outside of episodes that take place in alternate timelines, this is the only multi-scene plotline in which Cartman acts in a traditionally moral way without any ulterior motive being indicated on-screen.
-Cartman will use an awkward pause during a conversation as an opportunity to casually remind Kenny that he hates him.
-[
-28
-]
-Cartman's mischievous treatment of Butters, and the relationship the duo shares, has received significant focus in the more recent seasons of the series.
-[
-7
-]
-This reflects Parker's interest, as the scenes between the two are the ones he most enjoys writing.
-[
-29
-]
-Several episodes concern Cartman's greed and his get-rich-quick schemes, although his numerous attempts to attain wealth generally fail.
-[
-9
-]
-His extreme disdain for
-hippies
-serves to satirize the
-counterculture of the 1960s
-and its influence in contemporary society,
-[
-30
-]
-reflecting Parker's real-life antipathy towards hippies.
-[
-31
-]
-Though the role is customarily taken by Stan or Kyle, Cartman will occasionally be the one to reflect on the lessons learned during the course of an episode with a speech that often begins with "You know, I've learned something today...".
-[
-32
-]
-Character
-Creation and design
-Cartman's hair, which is usually hidden underneath his hat
-A precursor to Cartman first appeared in the first
-The Spirit of Christmas
-short, dubbed
-Jesus vs. Frosty
-, created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the
-University of Colorado
-. In the short, the character resembling Cartman was named "Kenny", and a variation of the catchphrase "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!" was exclaimed when this character was killed by an evil snowman. The character was composed of
-construction paper
-cutouts and animated through the use of
-stop motion
-.
-[
-33
-]
-When commissioned three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another short as a
-video
-Christmas card
-that he could send to friends, Parker and Stone created another similarly-animated
-The Spirit of Christmas
-short, dubbed
-Jesus vs. Santa
-.
-[
-34
-]
-In this short, his character first appears as he does in the series, and is given the name "Cartman", while the character of Kenny appears as the character is depicted today and given Cartman's moniker from the previous short. Cartman next appeared on August 13, 1997, when
-South Park
-debuted on
-Comedy Central
-with the episode "
-Cartman Gets an Anal Probe
-".
-In keeping with the show's
-animation style
-, Cartman is composed of simple geometrical shapes and
-primary colors
-.
-[
-33
-]
-[
-35
-]
-He is not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters; his character is mostly shown from one direction, and his movements intentionally jerky.
-[
-7
-]
-[
-33
-]
-[
-35
-]
-Ever since the show's second episode, "
-Weight Gain 4000
-" (
-season one
-, 1997), Cartman, like all other characters on the show, has been animated with computer software, though he is portrayed to give the impression that the show still utilizes its original technique.
-[
-33
-]
-Cartman is usually depicted wearing winter attire which consists of a red coat, brown pants, yellow gloves/mittens, and a yellow-brimmed turquoise
-knit cap
-tapered with a yellow
-pom-pom
-. He has parted brown hair, and he is seen without his hat more often than the other characters with distinctive headwear. As he is overweight, his body is wider and his hands noticeably larger than those of the other children, and his head is more elliptical. An additional curved line on his lower face represents a double chin.
-Parker adduced that he came up with the voice of Cartman while he and Stone were in film class, where they would speak in high-pitched childish voices, which was quite irksome to their film teachers. They would naturally reproduce these voices in the initial seasons of
-South Park
-.
-[
-36
-]
-[
-37
-]
-Although he had originally voiced Cartman without any computer manipulation, Parker now does so by speaking within his normal vocal range with a childlike inflection. The recorded audio is then edited with
-Pro Tools
-, and the pitch is altered to make the voice sound like that of a fourth grader.
-[
-38
-]
-[
-39
-]
-[
-40
-]
-Parker says to achieve the effect of Cartman's voice, he simply uses the same technique when voicing Stan while "adding a lot of fat to it".
-[
-41
-]
-Development
-Cartman is voiced by series co-creator
-Trey Parker
-.
-Cartman is partially named after and based on Matt Karpman, a high school classmate of Parker who remains a friend of both Parker and Stone.
-[
-42
-]
-Cartman is also inspired to some degree by
-All in the Family
-patriarch
-Archie Bunker
-, who is himself inspired by
-Alf Garnett
-from
-Till Death Us Do Part
-, the original British version of
-All in the Family
-. Parker and Stone are reportedly big fans of
-All in the Family
-. They alleged in 2008 that creating Cartman as a "little eight-year-old fat kid" made it easier for the two to portray a Bunker-like character after the introduction of
-political correctness
-to late-20th century television.
-[
-9
-]
-[
-43
-]
-While developing the character, Parker noted that everyone either remembers "an annoying fat kid in their pasts", or "they were the annoying fat kid".
-[
-44
-]
-Stone has observed that "kids are not nice, innocent, flower-loving little rainbow children ... they don't have any kind of social tact or etiquette, they're just complete little raging bastards".
-[
-11
-]
-In the
-season five
-(2001) episode "
-Scott Tenorman Must Die
-", Cartman is tricked into buying the
-pubic hair
-of a local ninth-grader named Scott Tenorman for $16.12. He then successfully executes an elaborate scheme to publicly humiliate Scott in front of his favorite band
-Radiohead
-, by getting Scott's parents killed and then tricking Scott into eating them.
-[
-45
-]
-The show's writers debated during production of the episode whether the incident would be "a step too far, even for Cartman".
-[
-9
-]
-Parker felt that the act could sufficiently be the culmination of Cartman's
-sociopathic
-behavior, and would "[set] a new bar" by portraying Cartman as being capable of performing anything short of murder.
-[
-9
-]
-[
-46
-]
-[
-47
-]
-[
-48
-]
-Fans reacted by ranking it as Cartman's "greatest moment" in a 2005 poll on
-Comedy Central
-'s website.
-[
-49
-]
-It is later revealed in the
-season fourteen
-episode "
-201
-" that Jack Tenorman, Scott's father, was a
-football
-player for the
-Denver Broncos
-who impregnated Cartman's mom, therefore making him Cartman's father too.
-[
-50
-]
-Parker and Stone, despite being the basis for Stan and Kyle, insist that Cartman is their favorite character, and the one with whom they identify the most.
-[
-9
-]
-[
-51
-]
-Personality and traits
-There's a big part of me that's Eric Cartman. He's both of our dark sides, the things we'd never say.
-Trey Parker
-[
-52
-]
-Cartman uses profanity (as do his friends) to provide a means for Parker and Stone to portray how they believe young boys really talk when they are alone.
-[
-35
-]
-[
-53
-]
-According to Parker, Cartman does not possess the "underlying sweetness" of the show's other child characters. Cartman is shown at times to be completely amoral and remorseless. Cartman, as with
-Stan Marsh
-and
-Kyle Broflovski
-, is amused by bodily functions and
-toilet humor
-,
-[
-54
-]
-and his favorite television personalities are
-Terrance and Phillip
-, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes.
-Cartman is sensitive and in denial about his
-obesity
-. He often reasserts Liane's notion by exclaiming "I'm not fat, I'm big-boned!" and will just as often either threaten to bring harm to anyone who mocks his weight or curse them out in aggravation.
-[
-9
-]
-He has also had people killed due to his insecurity; for example, after his psychiatrist mocked his weight, Cartman framed the man as a
-pedophile
-to his wife, causing her to commit
-suicide
-.
-[
-55
-]
-He views himself as more mature than his fellow friends and classmates, and often grows impatient with their company; despite claiming to be more mature, he will often break down crying childishly and pathetically whenever he feels defeated. This often leads to loud arguments, which in earlier seasons typically end with Cartman peevishly saying "Screw you guys ... I'm going home!" and then leaving.
-[
-9
-]
-In an action
-King's College
-philosophy
-professor
-David Kyle Johnson
-describes as "directed either toward accomplishing his own happiness or the unhappiness of others", Cartman often feigns actual friendship with his classmates when needing a favor.
-[
-15
-]
-The lack of a true father figure in his life, and Liane's promiscuity and drug use have caused repressed
-psychological
-hardship in Cartman's life. As a parent, Liane often spoils Cartman,
-[
-56
-]
-[
-57
-]
-and is largely ineffectual as a disciplinarian.
-[
-58
-]
-Cartman sometimes commands his mom to do tasks for him, but more often resorts to pleading with her in an ingratiating tone. When neither method works, he resorts to excessive and indecipherable whining, to which Liane usually succumbs.
-[
-59
-]
-Parker has noted that this is the primary cause for Cartman's behavior, stating that Cartman is "just a product of his environment".
-[
-9
-]
-We always had this thing where Cartman's mother was so sweet—she was always so sweet to him and giving him whatever he wanted. And I don't know if it's worse in L.A. than most places in the country—I hope so—but [we've met] so many parents who were just so desperately trying to be friends to their kids. And it was the thing we really picked up on. And it was just like, 'These [people] are making these really evil kids'.
-– Trey Parker, discussing Liane's role in shaping Cartman's personality in an interview with
-NPR
-[
-9
-]
-Cartman thrives on achieving ascendancy over others,
-[
-60
-]
-and exerts his will by
-demagoguery
-and by demanding that others "Respect my authoritah!"
-[
-9
-]
-Cartman has several times declared that his dream is getting "Ten million dollars", and that if he got it he would be "so happy". He has shown initiative in taking a businesslike approach to earning money, starting his own "
-hippie
-control" and "parental revenge" operations, as well as a
-Christian Rock
-and a
-boy band
-, a basketball team of
-crack babies
-(parody of the
-NCAA
-) and his own church.
-[
-61
-]
-Cartman's anti-Semitism, while mostly limited to mocking Kyle, culminates in the
-season eight
-episode "
-The Passion of the Jew
-". In the episode, Cartman, after watching
-The Passion of the Christ
-numerous times,
-deifies
-the film's director,
-Mel Gibson
-, and starts an official Gibson fan club, praising Gibson for "trying to express—through cinema—the horror and filthiness of the common Jew".
-[
-62
-]
-Cartman's interpretation of the film influences him to dress up as
-Adolf Hitler
-and lead other fan club members (who are oblivious of Cartman's actual intentions) in a failed effort to engage in a systematic
-genocide
-of the Jews similar to that of the
-Final Solution
-.
-[
-62
-]
-In the
-season 10
-episode "
-Smug Alert!
-", Cartman anonymously saves Kyle's life in an effort to get him and his family to return to South Park from
-San Francisco
-, revealing that he craves the animosity shared between the two.
-[
-63
-]
-Cartman later directs the "evil god"
-Cthulhu
-to destroy "most of the synagogues" during the
-season 14
-episode "
-Coon vs. Coon and Friends
-".
-[
-64
-]
-Upon hearing his classmates tell him that they hold him in the lowest regard possible and that they could not possibly think any worse of him, a stubborn Cartman misinterprets this act as their attempt to make him feel better, and convinces himself that everyone thinks he is the "coolest kid in school". In the
-season 13
-(2009) episode "
-Fishsticks
-", Cartman subconsciously believes that he helped in creating a joke that quickly becomes a nationwide sensation, despite the fact that the character
-Jimmy Valmer
-writes the joke without any assistance. Carlos Delgado of
-If Magazine
-noted this as "Cartman being so egotistical that he manipulates the past to serve his own purposes".
-[
-65
-]
-Though he is commonly portrayed as having a chauvinist disrespect for foreign cultures, Cartman is shown at least twice ("
-My Future Self n' Me
-" and "
-Pandemic
-") to be able to speak fluent Spanish (and German).
-[
-66
-]
-Cultural impact
-Cartman is a
-South Park
-fan favorite,
-[
-8
-]
-and is often described as the most famous character from the series as well as having a significant influence on comedy and culture.
-[
-9
-]
-[
-67
-]
-[
-68
-]
-With a headline to their online written version of a radio report,
-NPR
-declared Cartman as "America's Favorite Little $@#&*%".
-[
-9
-]
-"Respect my authoritah!" and "Screw you guys ... I'm going home!" became catchphrases and, during the show's earlier seasons, were highly popular in the lexicon of viewers.
-[
-69
-]
-[
-70
-]
-His eccentric enunciation of "Hey!" was included in the 2002 edition of
-The Oxford Dictionary of Catchphrases
-.
-[
-71
-]
-Stone has said that when fans recognize him or Parker, the fans will usually do their imitation of Cartman, or, in Parker's case, request that he do Cartman's voice.
-[
-72
-]
-In 2005,
-Comedy Central
-ran a three-night marathon of episodes showcasing what voters had deemed to be his "25 greatest moments".
-[
-49
-]
-A two-disc DVD collection entitled "
-The Cult of Cartman
-", which Comedy Central described as "12 classic episodes with Cartman at his very worst!", was released in 2008.
-[
-73
-]
-In a 1999 poll conducted by
-NatWest Bank
-, eight and nine-year-old children in the United Kingdom voted Cartman as their favorite personality. This drew the concern of several parent councils who were expecting a character from a television show aimed at children to top the list, to which Stone responded by claiming the results of the poll were "upsetting to people who have an idyllic vision of what kids are like".
-[
-74
-]
-While some in the
-Jewish community
-have praised the show's depiction of Cartman holding an anti-Semitic attitude towards Kyle as a means of accurately portraying what it is like for a young Jew to have to endure prejudice,
-[
-75
-]
-other Jews have blamed
-South Park
-and Cartman for having found themselves surrounded by "acceptable racism".
-[
-76
-]
-On November 20, 2008, a
-Facebook
-group titled "National Kick a Ginger Day, are you going to do it?" surfaced, suggesting abuse towards
-redheads
-. Thousands of internet users signed up as a member of the group, and reports of a feared increase of bullying of
-red-headed
-students across Canada soon followed. The group's administrator, a 14-year-old from
-Vancouver Island
-, said the group was only intended as a joke, and apologized for the offense it caused. The group was inspired by the
-season nine
-(2005) episode "
-Ginger Kids
-", in which Cartman incites prejudice towards those with red hair, pale skin, and freckles, a group he calls "Gingers" and claims are inherently evil and without souls.
-[
-77
-]
-A cosplayer as Cartman at a convention
-Other characters commonly express lessons learned from the antagonistic actions Cartman commonly provokes; this has resulted in these characters giving their opinions on issues such as
-hate crime legislation
-,
-[

-civil liberties
-,
-[

-excessive religious devotion,

-and

-[

-]
-In the
-season 10
-(2006) episode "
-Cartoon Wars Part II
-", Cartman, planning to exploit the public's fear of
-terrorism
-, seeks to get the
-Fox
-television series
-Family Guy
-, a program he despises, permanently removed from the airwaves when Fox plans to air an episode despite its inclusion of a cartoon likeness of
-Muhammad
-. This leads Kyle to give a short speech about the ethics of
-censorship
-,
-[
-82
-]
-which reiterates Parker and Stone's sentiments of "Either it's all okay, or none of it is" in regards to whether any subject should remain off-limits to satire.
-[
-83
-]
-Both Cartman's commentary and the commentary resulting in response to his actions have been interpreted as statements Parker and Stone are attempting to make to the viewing public, and these opinions have been subject to much critical analysis in the media and literary world.

-Main article:
-List of
-South Park
-characters
-South Park
-centers around four boys:
-Stan Marsh
-,
-Kyle Broflovski
-,
-Eric Cartman
-and
-Kenny McCormick
-. The boys live in the
-fictional small town
-of South Park, located within the real-life
-South Park basin
-in the
-Rocky Mountains
-of central
-Colorado
-,
-[
-7
-]
-approximately a one-hour drive from
-Denver
-.
-[
-8
-]
-The town is also home to an assortment of other characters, including
-students
-,
-families
-,
-elementary school staff
-, and other
-various residents
-.
-[
-9
-]
-Prominent settings include South Park Elementary, various neighborhoods and the surrounding mountain range, actual Colorado landmarks, and the businesses along the town's main street, all of which are based on the appearance of similar locations in
-Fairplay, Colorado
-.
-[
-7
-]
-[
-9
-]
-As one of the few television programs set in the
-Mountain West
-region that takes place outside the urban core of Denver,
-South Park
-frequently features the unique culture of the region, including cattle ranchers, Old West theme parks, snowy climates, mountaineering,
-Mormons
-, real-life Colorado locations such as
-Casa Bonita
-and
-Cave of the Winds
-, and many other regionally specific characteristics.
-Stan is portrayed as an average American boy; however, he has many mishaps throughout the series. In the first 22 seasons, Stan lived in South Park, but in the episodes during and after
-season 22
-, Stan resided in Tegridy Farms. Kyle is
-Jewish
-, and his portrayal as one of the few such people in South Park is often dealt with satirically.
-[
-10
-]
-Stan is modeled after Parker, while Kyle is modeled after Stone. They are best friends, and their friendship, symbolically intended to reflect Parker and Stone's friendship,
-[
-11
-]
-is a common topic throughout the series. Cartman (as he is commonly referred to) is amoral and increasingly
-psychopathic
-, and is commonly portrayed as an
-antagonist
-. His staunch
-antisemitism
-has resulted in a progressive rivalry with Kyle.
-[
-10
-]
-[
-12
-]
-Kenny, who comes from a poor family, tightly wears his
-parka
-hood to the point where it obscures most of his face and muffles his speech. During the first five seasons, Kenny died in almost every episode before reappearing in the next with no definite explanation. He was killed off in the
-fifth season
-episode "
-Kenny Dies
-", before being reintroduced in the sixth season finale, "
-Red Sleigh Down
-". Since then, Kenny is depicted as dying sporadically. During the first 58 episodes, the children were in the
-third grade
-. During the
-fourth season
-, they entered the
-fourth grade
-, where they have remained ever since.
-[

-]
-[
-14
-]
-Plots are often set in motion by events, ranging from the fairly typical to the supernatural and extraordinary, which frequently happen in the town.
-[
-15
-]
-The boys often act as the voice of reason when these events cause panic or incongruous behavior among the adult populace, who are customarily depicted as irrational, gullible, and prone to overreaction.
-[
-7
-]
-[
-16
-]
-They are frequently confused by the contradictory and hypocritical behavior of their parents and other adults, and often perceive them as having distorted views on morality and society.

-[

-Early episodes tended to be
-shock value
--oriented and featured more slapstick-style humor.
-[
-33
-]
-While social
-satire
-had been used on the show occasionally earlier on, it became more prevalent as the series progressed, with the show retaining some of its focus on the boys' fondness of
-scatological humor
-in an attempt to remind adult viewers "what it was like to be eight years old".
-[
-10
-]
-Parker and Stone also began further developing other characters by giving them larger roles in certain storylines,
-[
-10
-]
-and began writing plots as parables based on religion, politics, and numerous other topics.
-[
-9
-]
-This provided the opportunity for the show to spoof both extreme sides of contentious issues,
-[
-34
-]
-while lampooning both
-liberal
-and
-conservative
-points of view.

-[

-[

-Rebecca Raphael described the show as "an equal opportunity offender",
-[
-15
-]
-while Parker and Stone describe their main purpose as to "be funny" and "make people laugh",
-[
-36
-]
-[
-37
-]
-while stating that no particular topic or group of people be exempt from mockery and satire.

-Parker and Stone insist that the show is still more about "kids being kids" and "what it's like to be in [elementary school] in
-America
-",
-[
-41
-]
-stating that the introduction of a more satirical element to the series was the result of the two adding more of a "moral center" to the show so that it would rely less on simply being crude and shocking in an attempt to maintain an audience.
-[
-36
-]
-[
-37
-]
-While profane, Parker notes that there is still an "underlying sweetness" aspect to the child characters,
-[
-34
-]
-and
-Time
-described the boys as "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence".
-[
-11
-]
-Usually, the boys or other characters pondered over what transpired during an episode and conveyed the important lesson taken from it with a short monologue. During earlier seasons, this speech commonly began with a variation of the phrase "You know, I've learned something today...".
-[

-]
-Development
-South Park
-creators
-Trey Parker
-(left) and
-Matt Stone
-continue to do most of the writing, directing and voice acting on the show.
-Parker and Stone met in film class at the
-University of Colorado
-in 1992 and discovered a shared love of
-Monty Python
-, which they often cite as one of their primary inspirations.
-[
-43
-]
-They created an
-animated short
-entitled
-The Spirit of Christmas
-.
-[
-27
-]
-The film was created by animating construction paper cutouts with
-stop motion
-, and features
-prototypes
-of the main characters of
-South Park
-, including a character resembling Cartman but named "Kenny", an unnamed character resembling what is today Kenny, and two near-identical unnamed characters who resemble Stan and Kyle.
-Fox Broadcasting Company
-executive and mutual friend
-Brian Graden
-commissioned Parker and Stone to create a second short film as a video Christmas card. Created in 1995, the second
-The Spirit of Christmas
-short resembled the style of the later series more closely.
-[
-44
-]
-To differentiate between the two homonymous shorts, the first short is often referred to as
-Jesus vs. Frosty
-, and the second short as
-Jesus vs. Santa
-. Graden sent copies of the video to several of his friends, and from there it was copied and distributed, including on the internet, where it became one of the first
-viral videos
-.
-[
-27
-]
-[
-11
-]
-As
-Jesus vs. Santa
-became more popular, Parker and Stone began talks of developing the short into a television series about four children residing in a fictional
-Colorado
-town in the real-life
-South Park
-basin. Fox eagerly agreed to meet with the duo about the show's premise, having prided itself on edgier products such as
-Cops
-,
-The Simpsons
-, and
-The X-Files
-. However, during the meeting at the Fox office in
-Century City
-, disagreements between the two creators and the network began to arise, mainly over the latter's refusal to air a show that included a supporting talking stool character named
-Mr. Hankey
-. Some executives at
-20th Century Fox Television
-(which was to produce the series) agreed with its then-sister network's stance on Mr. Hankey and repeatedly requested Parker and Stone to remove the character in order for the show to proceed. Refusing to meet their demands, the duo cut ties with Fox and its sister companies all together and began shopping the series somewhere else.
-[
-45
-]
-[
-46
-]
-[
-47
-]
-The two then entered negotiations with both
-MTV
-and
-Comedy Central
-. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids show.
-[
-48
-]
-When Comedy Central executive
-Doug Herzog
-watched the short, he commissioned for it to be developed into a series.
-[
-27
-]
-[
-49
-]
-Parker and Stone assembled a small staff and spent three months creating the
-pilot
-episode "
-Cartman Gets an Anal Probe
-".
-[
-50
-]
-South Park
-was in danger of being canceled before it even aired when the show fared poorly with test audiences, particularly with women. However, the shorts were still gaining more popularity over the Internet, and Comedy Central ordered a run of six episodes.
-[
-36
-]
-[
-48
-]
-South Park
-debuted with "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" on August 13, 1997.
-[
-51
-]
-Production
-Except for the pilot episode, which was produced using
-cutout animation
-, all episodes of
-South Park
-are created with the use of software, primarily
-Autodesk Maya
-.
-[
-52
-]
-As opposed to the pilot, which took three months to complete,
-[
-53
-]
-and other animated sitcoms, which are traditionally
-hand-drawn
-by companies in
-South Korea
-in a process that takes roughly eight to nine months,
-[
-27
-]
-[
-35
-]
-individual episodes of
-South Park
-take significantly less time to produce. Using computers as an animation method, the show's production staff were able to generate an episode in about three weeks during the first seasons.
-[
-54
-]
-Now, with a staff of about 70 people, episodes are typically completed in one week,
-[
-27
-]
-[
-34
-]
-[
-35
-]
-with some in as little as three to four days.
-[
-55
-]
-[
-56
-]
-[
-57
-]
-Nearly the entire production of an episode is accomplished within one set of offices, which were originally at a complex in
-Westwood, Los Angeles, California
-and are now part of South Park Studios in
-Culver City, California
-.
-[
-49
-]
-[
-53
-]
-Parker and Stone have been the show's executive producers throughout its entire history.
-[
-58
-]
-Debbie Liebling
-, who was Senior Vice President of original programming and development for Comedy Central, also served as an executive producer during the show's first five seasons, coordinating the show's production efforts between South Park Studios and Comedy Central's headquarters in New York City.
-[

-]
-[

-]
-During its early stages, finished episodes of
-South Park
-were hastily recorded to
-D-2
-to be sent to
-Comedy Central
-for airing in just a few days' time.
-[
-61
-]
-Each episode used to cost $250,000.

-Writing
-The Border Patrol raid during the
-Elián González
-affair is referenced in "
-Quintuplets 2000
-", which aired within the same week the event occurred.
-Scripts are not written before a season begins.
-[
-63
-]
-Production of an episode begins on a Thursday, with the show's writing consultants
-brainstorming
-with Parker and Stone. Former staff writers include
-Pam Brady
-, who has since written scripts for the films
-Hot Rod
-,
-Hamlet 2
-and
-Team America: World Police
-(with Parker and Stone), and
-Nancy Pimental
-, who served as co-host of
-Win Ben Stein's Money
-and wrote the film
-The Sweetest Thing
-after her tenure with the show during its first three seasons.
-[
-64
-]
-[
-65
-]
-Television producer and writer
-Norman Lear
-, an idol of both Parker and Stone, served as a guest writing consultant for the
-season seven
-(2003) episodes "
-Cancelled
-" and "
-I'm a Little Bit Country
-".
-[

-]
-[
-66
-]
-[
-67
-]
-During the 12th and 13th seasons,
-Saturday Night Live
-actor and writer
-Bill Hader
-served as a
-creative consultant
-and co-producer.
-[
-68
-]
-[
-69
-]
-[
-70
-]
-After exchanging ideas, Parker will write a script, and from there the entire team of animators, editors, technicians, and sound engineers will each typically work 100–120 hours in the ensuing week.
-[
-50
-]
-Since the show's
-fourth season
-(2000), Parker has assumed most of the show's directorial duties, while Stone relinquished his share of the directing to focus on handling the coordination and business aspects of the production.
-[

-On Wednesday, a completed episode is sent to Comedy Central's headquarters via satellite uplink, sometimes just a few hours before its air time of 10 PM
-Eastern Time
-.
-[
-27
-]
-[
-72
-]
-Parker and Stone state that subjecting themselves to a one-week deadline creates more spontaneity amongst themselves in the creative process, which they feel results in a funnier show.
-[
-27
-]
-The schedule also allows
-South Park
-to both stay more topical and respond more quickly to specific current events than other satiric animated shows.
-[
-10
-]
-[
-73
-]
-One of the earliest examples of this was in the
-season four
-(2000) episode "
-Quintuplets 2000
-", which references the
-United States Border Patrol
-'s raid of a house during the
-Elián González affair
-, an event which occurred only four days before the episode originally aired.
-[
-74
-]
-The
-season nine
-(2005) episode "
-Best Friends Forever
-" references the
-Terri Schiavo case
-,
-[
-25
-]
-[
-34
-]
-and originally aired in the midst of the controversy and less than 12 hours before she died.
-[
-35
-]
-[
-75
-]
-A scene in the
-season seven
-(2003) finale "
-It's Christmas in Canada
-" references the discovery of dictator
-Saddam Hussein
-in a "spider hole" and his subsequent
-capture
-, which happened a mere three days prior to the episode airing.
-[
-76
-]
-The
-season 12
-(2008) episode "
-About Last Night...
-" revolves around
-Barack Obama
-'s victory in the
-2008 presidential election
-, and aired less than 24 hours after Obama was declared the winner, using segments of dialogue from Obama's real victory speech.
-[
-77
-]
-On October 16, 2013, the show failed to meet their production deadline for the first time ever, after a power outage on October 15 at the production studio prevented the episode, season 17's "
-Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers
-", from being finished in time. The episode was rescheduled to air a week later on October 23, 2013.
-[
-78
-]
-Animation
-The various stages of production (from top to bottom): the storyboard sketch, the CorelDRAW props with stock character models, and a frame from the fully rendered episode, "
-Super Fun Time
-"
-The show's style of animation is inspired by the paper cut-out cartoons made by
-Terry Gilliam
-for
-Monty Python's Flying Circus
-, of which Parker and Stone have been lifelong fans.
-[
-48
-]
-[
-11
-]
-[
-79
-]
-Construction paper
-and traditional
-stop motion
-cutout animation
-techniques were used in the original animated shorts and in the pilot episode. Subsequent episodes have been produced by
-computer animation
-, providing a similar look to the originals while requiring a fraction of the time to produce. Before computer artists begin animating an episode, a series of
-animatics
-drawn in
-Toon Boom
-are provided by the show's storyboard artists.
-[
-50
-]
-[
-80
-]
-The characters and objects are composed of simple geometrical shapes and
-primary
-and
-secondary colors
-. Most child characters are the same size and shape, and are distinguished by their clothing, hair and skin colors, and headwear.
-[
-17
-]
-Characters are mostly presented two-dimensionally and from only one angle. Their movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion, as they are purposely not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters.
-[
-10
-]
-[
-53
-]
-[
-81
-]
-Occasionally, some non-fictional characters are depicted with photographic cutouts of their actual head and face in lieu of a face reminiscent of the show's traditional style. Canadians on the show are often portrayed in an even more minimalist fashion; they have simple beady eyes, and the top halves of their heads simply flap up and down when the characters speak.
-[
-38
-]
-When the show began using computers, the cardboard cutouts were scanned and re-drawn with
-CorelDRAW
-, then imported into
-PowerAnimator
-, which was used with
-SGI
-workstations to animate the characters.
-[
-50
-]
-[
-53
-]
-The workstations were linked to a 54-processor
-render farm
-that could render 10 to 15
-shots
-an hour.
-[
-50
-]
-Beginning with
-season five
-, the animators began using
-Maya
-instead of PowerAnimator.
-[
-82
-]
-As of 2012, the studio ran a 120-processor render farm that can produce 30 or more shots an hour.
-[
-50
-]
-PowerAnimator and Maya are high-end programs mainly used for
-3D computer graphics
-, while co-producer and former animation director
-Eric Stough
-notes that PowerAnimator was initially chosen because its features helped animators retain the show's "homemade" look.
-[
-53
-]
-PowerAnimator was also used for making some of the show's visual effects,
-[
-53
-]
-which are now created using
-Motion
-,
-[
-50
-]
-a newer graphics program created by
-Apple, Inc.
-for their
-Mac OS X
-operating system
-. The show's visual quality has improved in recent seasons,
-[
-10
-]
-though several other techniques are used to intentionally preserve the cheap cutout animation look.
-[
-27
-]
-[
-54
-]
-[
-83
-]
-A few episodes feature sections of
-live-action
-footage, while others have incorporated other styles of animation. Portions of the
-season eight
-(2004) premiere "
-Good Times with Weapons
-" are done in
-anime
-style, while the
-season 10
-episode "
-Make Love, Not Warcraft
-" is done partly in

-have guest starred as other speaking characters. During
-South Park
-'s earliest seasons, several high-profile celebrities inquired about guest-starring on the show. As a joke, Parker and Stone responded by offering low-profile, non-speaking roles, most of which were accepted;
-George Clooney
-provided the barks for Stan's dog Sparky in the
-season one
-(1997) episode "
-Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride
-",
-[

-Leno provided the meows for Cartman's cat in the season one finale "
-Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut
-",
-[

-and
-Henry Winkler
-voiced the various growls and grunts of a kid-eating monster in the

-(1998) episode "

-".

-Jerry Seinfeld
-offered to lend his voice for the
-Thanksgiving
-episode "
-Starvin' Marvin
-", but declined to appear when he was only offered a role as "Turkey #2".

-Music
-Chef
-would often sing in a style reminiscent of that of his voice actor,
-Isaac Hayes
-.
-Parker says that the varying uses of music are of utmost importance to
-South Park
-.
-[
-113
-]
-Several characters often play or sing songs in order to change or influence a group's behavior, or to educate, motivate, or indoctrinate others. The show also frequently features scenes in which its characters have disapproving reactions to the performances of certain popular musicians.
-[
-113
-]
-Adam Berry
-, the show's original score composer, used
-sound synthesis
-to simulate a small orchestra, and frequently alluded to existing famous pieces of music. Berry also used signature acoustic guitar and mandolin cues as
-leitmotifs
-for the show's establishing shots.
-[
-113
-]
-[
-114
-]
-After Berry left in 2001, Jamie Dunlap and Scott Nickoley of the Los Angeles-based Mad City Production Studios provided the show's original music for the next seven seasons.
-[
-93
-]
-Since 2008, Dunlap has been credited as the show's sole score composer.
-[
-115
-]
-Dunlap's contributions to the show are one of the few that are not achieved at the show's own production offices. Dunlap reads a script, creates a score using digital audio software, and then e-mails the audio file to South Park Studios, where it is edited to fit with the completed episode.
-[
-93
-]
-In addition to singing in an effort to explain something to the children, Chef would also sing about things relevant to what had transpired in the plot. These songs were original compositions written by Parker, and they were performed by Hayes in the same sexually suggestive
-R&B
-style he had used during his own music career. The band DVDA, which consists of Parker and Stone, along with show staff members Bruce Howell and D.A. Young, performed the music for these compositions and, until the character's death on the show, were listed as "Chef's Band" in the closing credits.

-Elton John
-,
-Meat Loaf
-,
-Joe Strummer

-Ozzy Osbourne
-,
-Primus
-,
-Rancid
-, and
-Ween
-all guest starred and briefly performed in the
-season two
-(1998) episode "
-Chef Aid
-". Korn debuted their single "
-Falling Away from Me
-" as guest stars on the
-season three
-(1999) episode "
-Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery
-".
-[
-103
-]
-Main theme
-The show's
-theme song
-was a musical score performed by the band
-Primus
-, with the lyrics alternately sung by the band's lead singer,
-Les Claypool
-, and the show's four central characters during the opening title sequence. Kenny's muffled lines are altered after every few seasons. His lines are usually
-sexually explicit
-in nature, such as his original lines, "I like girls with big fat titties, I like girls with deep vaginas".
-[
-116
-]
-The original unaired opening composition was originally slower and had a length of 40 seconds. It was deemed too long for the opening sequence. So Parker and Stone sped it up for the show's opening, having Claypool re-record his vocals. The
-instrumental
-version of the original composition is often played during the show's closing credits.
-[
-117
-]
-The opening song played in the first four seasons (and the end credits in all seasons) has a
-folk rock
-instrumentation with
-bass guitar
-,
-trumpets
-and rhythmic drums. Its
-beat
-is fast in the opening and leisurely in the closing credits. It is in the
-minor key
-and it features a
-tritone
-or a diminished fifth, creating a melodic
-dissonance
-, which captures the show's surrealistic nature.
-[
-how?
-]
-In the latter parts of seasons 4 and 5, the opening tune has an
-electro funk
-arrangement with
-pop
-qualities. Seasons 6–9 have a sprightly
-bluegrass
-instrumentation with a usage of
-banjo
-and is set in the
-major key
-. For the later seasons, the arrangement is
-electro rock
-with a
-breakbeat
-influence, which feature
-electric guitars
-backed up by
-synthesized
-,
-groovy
-drumbeats.
-[
-93
-]
-The opening theme song has been remixed three times during the course of the series, including a remix performed by
-Paul Robb
-.
-[
-118
-]
-In 2006, the theme music was remixed with the song "Whamola" by
-Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade
-, from the album
-Purple Onion
-.

-Streaming
-In March 2008, Comedy Central made every episode of
-South Park
-available for free full-length
-on-demand
-legal streaming
-on the official South Park Studios website.
-[
-145
-]
-From March 2008 until December 2013, new episodes were added to the site the day following their debut, and an uncensored version was posted the following day. The episode stayed up for the remainder of the week, then taken down, and added to the site three weeks later.
-Within a week, the site served more than a million streams of full episodes,
-[
-145
-]
-and the number grew to 55 million by October 2008.
-[
-146
-]
-Legal issues prevent the U.S. content from being accessible outside the United States,
-[
-147
-]
-so local servers have been set up in other countries.
-[
-148
-]
-In September 2009, a South Park Studios website with streaming episodes was launched in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
-[
-149
-]
-In Canada, episodes were available for streaming from The Comedy Network's website, though due to digital rights restrictions, they are no longer available.
-[
-150
-]
-In April 2010, the season five episode "
-Super Best Friends
-" and the season fourteen episodes "
-200
-" and "
-201
-" were removed from the site; additionally, these episodes no longer air in reruns and are only available exclusively on DVD and Blu-ray. These episodes remain unavailable following the 2014 purchase by Hulu.
-In July 2014, it was announced that
-Hulu
-had signed a three-year deal purchasing exclusive online streaming rights to the
-South Park
-for a reported $80 million. Following the announcement every episode remained available for free on the South Park Studios website, using the Hulu
-player
-. As of September 2014, following the premiere of the eighteenth season, only 30 select episodes would be featured for free viewing at a time on a rotating basis on the website, with new episodes being available for an entire month starting the day following their original airings. The entire series was available on Hulu by this point.
-[
-151
-]
-As of July 2015, all episodes of
-South Park
-are available for streaming in Canada on the service
-CraveTV
-, which first consisted of seasons 1–18. Subsequent seasons were released the following July.
-[
-152
-]
-In early October 2019, industry rumors suggested that the streaming rights for
-South Park
-were being offered to various services, creating an intense bidding war that was estimated to be as high as
-US$500 million
-. HBO and South Park Digital Studios announced that HBO had secured a multi-year deal for the exclusive streaming rights for
-South Park
-on their
-HBO Max
-service starting June 24, 2020.
-[
-153
-]
-While the terms of the deal were not disclosed,
-Variety
-reported the deal fell between
-US$500 million
-and
-US$550 million
-.
-[
-154
-]
-Beginning with season 25 in 2022, HBO Max posts new episodes the next day after their Comedy Central airing.
-[
-155
-]
-Once that deal expires in 2025,
-Paramount+
-will become the exclusive streaming home. In addition, the season 27 episodes would stream first on Paramount+ before hitting HBO Max.
-[
-156
-]
-Though season 27 would have originally aired in 2024, the season was delayed due to what Parker and Stone claimed to be uncertainties about the
-2024 United States presidential election
-(mainly the exhaustion of
-humor set around Donald Trump
-), along with the
-proposed merger of Skydance Media and Paramount Global
-.
-[
-157
-]
-In February 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery filed a lawsuit which claimed that Paramount breached its exclusivity contract with HBO Max by airing
-South Park
-on its own streaming platform.

-From its debut in 1997 to the
-season twelve finale
-in 2008 the series had been originally produced in
-standard definition

-[

-re-rendered
-in high definition. The aspect ratio of these episodes were also converted from 4:3 to 16:9 as well.
-[
-159

-[
-160

-[

-controversy surrounding episode "201"
-, was not released alongside the rest of the season when it was released in HD on iTunes in 2011. The episode was later re-rendered and made available for the Blu-ray release of the season that was released on December 5, 2017.
-[

-The episode is presented in its original presentation, without Muhammad's image being obscured as in later episodes of the series.

-Reception
-Ratings
-When
-South Park
-debuted, it was a huge ratings success for Comedy Central and is seen as being largely responsible for the success of the channel, with Herzog crediting it for putting the network "on the map".
-[
-27
-]
-[
-49
-]
-[
-164
-]
-The show's first episode, "
-Cartman Gets an Anal Probe
-", earned a
-Nielsen
-rating of 1.3 (980,000 viewers), at the time considered high for a
-cable program
-.
-[
-164
-]
-The show instantly generated buzz among television viewers, and mass viewing parties began assembling on college campuses.
-[
-21
-]
-[
-15
-]
-[
-23
-]
-By the time the eighth episode, "
-Starvin' Marvin
-", aired—three months after the show debuted—ratings and viewership had tripled, and
-South Park
-was already the most successful show in Comedy Central's history.
-[
-23
-]
-When the tenth episode "
-Damien
-" aired the following February, viewership increased another 33 percent. The episode earned a 6.4 rating, which at the time was over 10 times the average rating earned by a cable show aired in
-prime time
-.
-[
-21
-]
-[
-164
-]
-The ratings peaked with the second episode of
-season two
-, "
-Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut
-", which aired on April 22, 1998. The episode earned an 8.2 rating (6.2 million viewers) and, at the time, set a record as the highest-rated non-sports show in basic cable history.
-[
-29
-]
-[
-37
-]
-[
-164
-]
-During the spring of 1998, eight of the ten highest-rated shows on basic cable were
-South Park
-episodes.
-[
-22
-]
-South Park's
-second season would average a 5.8 rating (12.5 million viewers) which was a lower rating due to Comedy Central's households being much higher.
-[
-clarification needed
-]
-The success of
-South Park
-prompted more cable companies to carry Comedy Central and led it to its becoming one of the fastest-growing cable channels. The number of households that had Comedy Central jumped from 9.1 million in 1997 to 50 million in June 1998.
-[
-164
-]
-When the show debuted, the most Comedy Central had earned for a 30-second commercial was US$7,500.
-[
-21
-]
-Within a year, advertisers were paying an average of US$40,000 for 30 seconds of advertising time during airings of
-South Park
-in its second season, while some paid as much as US$80,000.
-[
-165
-]
-By the third season (1999), the series' ratings began to decrease.
-[
-166
-]
-The third-season premiere episode drew 3.4 million viewers, a dramatic drop from the 5.5 million of the previous season's premiere.
-[
-164
-]
-Stone and Parker attributed this drop in the show's ratings to the media hype that surrounded the show in the previous year, adding that the third season ratings reflected the show's "true" fan base.
-[
-164
-]
-Regardless the viewership stayed consistent with an average rating being between 3.0 (8 million viewers) to a 5.5 (17.5 million viewers). The show's ratings dropped further in its fourth season (2000), with episodes averaging just above 1.5 million viewers (though the season premiere would get 22.1 million viewers due to the hype caused by the movie). The ratings eventually increased, and seasons five through nine consistently averaged about 3 million viewers per episode.
-[
-164
-]
-Season 8's episode "Goobacks" would have
-South Park
-'s
-viewership peak at 30 million viewers. Seasons 10 to 12 would average 5 million viewers. Though its viewership is lower than it was at the height of its popularity in its earliest seasons,
-South Park
-remains one of the highest-rated series on Comedy Central.
-[
-167
-]

-The author of the post,
-Zachary Adam Chesser
-(whose alias is Abu Talhah al-Amrikee),

-Soon after one of Kenny's trademark deaths on the show, other characters would typically shout "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!", followed by another yelling out "You bastard(s)!"—these lines were usually said by the characters Stan and Kyle, respectively.

-Another season two episode, "
-Gnomes
-", revolves around a group of "underpants

-" who, as their name suggests, run a corporation stealing people's underpants. When asked about their business model, various gnomes reply that theirs is a three-step process: Phase 1 is "collect underpants". Phase 3 is "profit". However, the gnomes are unable to explain what is to occur between the first and final steps, and "Phase 2" is accompanied by a large question mark on their corporate flow chart. Using "????" and "PROFIT!" as the last two steps in a process (usually jokingly) became a widely popular
-Internet meme
-because of this.
-[
-232

-Political
-Main article:
-South Park Republican
-While some
-conservatives
-have condemned
-South Park
-for its vulgarity, a growing population of people who hold
-center-right
-political beliefs, including teenagers and young adults, have embraced the show for its tendency to mock
-liberal
-viewpoints and lampoon liberal celebrities and icons.
-[
-240
-]
-Political commentator
-Andrew Sullivan
-dubbed the group
-South Park
-Republicans
-, or
-South Park
-conservatives.
-[

-]
-[
-241
-]
-[
-242
-]
-Sullivan averred that members of the group are "extremely skeptical of political correctness but also are socially liberal on many issues", though he says the phrase applied to them is meant to be more of a casual indication of beliefs than a strong partisan label.
-[
-16
-]
-[
-40
-]
-Brian C. Anderson
-describes the group as "generally characterized by holding strong
-libertarian
-beliefs and rejecting more conservative social policy", and notes that although the show makes "wicked fun of conservatives", it is "at the forefront of a conservative revolt against liberal media" and Hollywood's "liberal hegemony".
-[
-240
-]
-[
-243

-Parker and Stone reject the idea that the show has any underlying political position, and deny having a political agenda when creating an episode.
-[

-]
-[
-242
-]
-[
-244
-]
-The two claim the show's higher proportion of instances lampooning liberal rather than conservative orthodoxies stems simply from their preference for making fun of liberals.
-[
-16
-]
-[
-73
-]
-While Stone has been quoted saying, "I hate conservatives, but I really fucking hate liberals", Stone and Parker have explained that their drive to lampoon a given target comes first from the target's insistence on telling other people how to behave.
-[
-195
-]
-The duo explain that they regard liberals as having both delusions of entitlement to remain free from satire, and a propensity to enforce political correctness while patronizing the citizens of
-Middle America
-.
-[

-Parker and Stone are uncomfortable with the idea of themselves or
-South Park
-being assigned any kind of
-partisan
-classification.
-[

-]
-[
-242
-]
-Parker said he rejects the "
-South Park
-Republican" and "
-South Park

-The duo has in the past reluctantly labeled themselves libertarians and fans of
-government gridlock

-I freaking
-love
-South Park. The satirical show has had its thumb on popular culture for the past 22 seasons, though it is really summing up the zeitgeist in our current political climate succinctly.
-“Put It Down”
-is more poignant than many actual political arguments.
-No doubt, one of the most iconic figures is professional pot-stirrer Eric Cartman. Hilariously self-centered and emotionally manipulative, Cartman adds the real spice to the show. While definitely a secondary character, Cartman’s mother provides an interesting flair to any scene she’s in. The relationship between the sweet woman and her spoiled son is obviously dysfunctional, but her love and devotion are real.
-Who has the best mom?
-INCOME:
-$18,200
-So let’s get to the nitty gritty! We know Liane Cartman works two jobs to pay the bills, and that Cartman family is the poorest in South Park outside of Kenny. She has had a previous crack addiction and has a healthy sexual appetite. She even modeled some for
-Crack Whore Magazine
-back in the day! Even though South Park isn’t trying to put a positive spin on her storyline (literally she started out as a way
-to slut shame Parker’s ex
-), I like Liane – she’s a good mother trying to raise a child with
-behavioral issues
-, she’s a single mother on a popular tv show, and she’s shown as
-enjoying sex
-.
-Liane Cartman
-It’s not exactly stated what her jobs are, so I got to get creative with this one! Her jobs must offer a good deal of flexibility since she’s always available for her son. With her previous modeling history, I wonder if she’s a sex worker, either in a more traditional sense or as a cam model. We need more
-normalization of sex work
-, so I’m rolling with it. Let’s assume that either through clients (4 clients) or cam sessions (10 hours a week at $30/hr), she’s able to bring down $1,200 a month. This is a conservative estimate, but does leave plenty of free time in her schedule and factors in age and tech savviness. Personal expenses such as lingerie, waxing, makeup, and blowouts can be written off on taxes, but still come in at an annual cost of at least $2,600. As a side note: I adore
-Refinery29’s Money Diaries
-(see my review on the book, site, and podcast
-here
-) and this one on a
-high profile cam girl
-is super enlightening.
-The episode
-“Cartmanland”
-gives us some good insight in the family dynamics of Cartman’s extended family. When Cartman’s grandmother Mabel dies, she leaves $1 million to him because the rest of the family would probably just “spend it on crack.” Getting in the punches even in death, Grandma.
-EXPENSES:
-$30,149
-Mabel clearly had some money know-how, and even though she wouldn’t have given cash to her daughter, I could see her purchasing a home and car to provide for her grandson. Nothing extravagant, but something to take the pressure off Liane. That leaves the unfixed expenses for Liane to take care of: health insurance, groceries, gas, and the like. Groceries will run about $400 a month between the copious amounts of junk food, energy drinks, and chocolate chicken pot pies. KFC, McDonald’s, and Mexican food will tack on almost another $1,500 a year! Gas and car insurance will run another $270 a month, and utilities roughly $556 a month (this includes electricity, water, waste, iPhones, internet, security, a variety of tv subscriptions, and cable).
-Finally, I think we can all agree that the highest expenses will come from Cartman’s expensive tastes. Weekends are filled with amusement parks, movie outings, and other events. Liane says she can’t afford a new iPad, but a
-Toshiba tablet
-is doable. Cartman often picks up pricey toys. Those things add up to at least another $100 monthly, with a much higher price tag during the holidays. Can you imagine being in charge of Cartman’s presents and holiday feasts during Christmas?!
-Go Fund Yourself.
-NET INCOME:
-$(11,949)
-All in all, if Liane didn’t bend to Cartman’s will on expenses, you could cut out restaurants, toys, allowances, and entertainment of nearly $5,000 a year. At least his more extravagant ventures are funded by his own ingenuity, like the
-Go Fund Yourself
-campaign.
-Still, here we have another example of tv magic – income and expenses are not matching up, even with credit card costs factored in. Perhaps Liane works more, but she would still need to bring in another $12,000 at least to break even. Chances are she’s skimping on savings, retirement, or health insurance to make ends meet while still providing Cartman with all the material items his heart desires.

-November 9, 2023
-Of course, Eric Cartman and his troupe of pint-sized rabble-rousers took a jab at our increasing dependence on apps and the existential dread tied to AI -- it was inevitable and paints a possibly bleaker outlook of the future than what George Jetson portrayed.
-In the recent animated special “South Park: Joining the Panderverse,” many white-collar workers found themselves in a bit of a role reversal with professionals trained in manual jobs.
-Electricians, mechanics, and others with the skills to build and maintain infrastructure and devices the world relies on became extremely in-demand because everyone else lacked such knowledge, depending on software to resolve their needs.
-The trouble was that apps and software directed users to find and hire someone to do the work, making the populace increasingly reliant on a shrinking pool of trained individuals who actually get their hands dirty.
-Handymen were offered increasing bids of thousands of dollars just to repair an oven door or fix electrical wiring that shorted out. People found themselves completely incapable of performing even simple tasks for themselves, eventually blaming their focus on college curriculum versus ever learning a craft or trade. At one point, one of these desperate, erudite sad sacks asked a digital assistant if it could do some repairs -- despite the app’s lack of a physical presence in the real world.

-Considering a Career as an IT Hardware Engineer?
-The “South Park” special also touched on AI overtaking certain jobs, including a scene where an AI therapy app made a therapist’s services redundant.
-Covering this month’s AI Safety Summit,

-reported that Elon Musk told British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak he expected AI to
-end the need for jobs.
-“There will come a point where no job is needed,” Musk reportedly said. “You can have a job if you want to have a job for personal satisfaction, but the AI will be able to do everything,”
-While Musk has vocalized his misgivings about AI, he also actively explores what his xAI efforts might bring to this space. Sunday saw the release of
-xAI’s Grok chatbot, a potential rival to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
-Between “South Park” and Musk’s musings, this is not quite the future depicted in classic cartoons such as “The Jetsons.” George Jetson mostly pushed a button at Spacely Space Sprockets, living in relative comfort with a mechanical maid and other automated resources taking up the slack. At the end of the day, Jetson still had a job and could maintain a household, which may become an increasing challenge based on commentary from “South Park” and others.

-The Spirit of Christmas
-South Park
-is an American
-animated sitcom
-created by
-Trey Parker
-and
-Matt Stone
-, and developed by
-Brian Graden
-for
-Comedy Central
-. The series revolves around four boys—
-Stan Marsh
-,
-Kyle Broflovski
-,
-Eric Cartman
-, and
-Kenny McCormick
-—and their exploits in and around the titular
-Colorado
-town.
-South Park
-also features many recurring characters. The series became infamous for its
-profanity
-and
-dark
-,
-surreal humor
-that
-satirizes
-a
-large range of subject matter
-.
-Parker and Stone developed
-South Park
-from two animated short films, both titled
-The Spirit of Christmas
-, released in 1992 and 1995. The second short became one of the first
-viral
-Internet videos, leading to the series' production. The
-pilot episode
-was produced using
-cutout animation
-; the remainder of the series uses
-computer animation
-recalling the prior technique. Since the fourth season, episodes have generally been written and produced during the week preceding their broadcast, with Parker serving as the lead writer and director.
-Since its debut on August 13, 1997,
-328 episodes
-of
-South Park
-have been broadcast. It debuted with great success, consistently earning the highest ratings of any basic cable program. Subsequent ratings have varied, but it remains one of Comedy Central's longest-running programs. In August 2021,
-South Park
-was renewed through 2027, and a series of television specials was announced for
-Paramount+
-, the first two of which were released later that year.
-[

-[

-In October 2019, it was announced that
-WarnerMedia
-had acquired exclusive streaming rights to
-South Park
-starting in June 2020 for
-HBO Max
-.
-[

-Primetime Emmy Awards
-and a
-Peabody Award
-. A theatrical film,
-South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut
-, was released in June 1999 to commercial and critical success, garnering an

-Premise
-Setting and characters
-Main article:
-List of
-South Park
-characters
-South Park
-centers around four boys:
-Stan Marsh
-,
-Kyle Broflovski
-,
-Eric Cartman
-and
-Kenny McCormick
-. The boys live in the
-fictional small town
-of South Park, located within the real-life
-South Park basin
-in the
-Rocky Mountains
-of central
-Colorado
-,
-[
-7
-]
-approximately a one-hour drive from
-Denver
-.
-[
-8
-]
-The town is also home to an assortment of other characters, including
-students
-,
-families
-,
-elementary school staff
-, and other
-various residents
-.
-[
-9
-]
-Prominent settings include South Park Elementary, various neighborhoods and the surrounding mountain range, actual Colorado landmarks, and the businesses along the town's main street, all of which are based on the appearance of similar locations in
-Fairplay, Colorado
-.
-[
-7
-]
-[
-9
-]
-As one of the few television programs set in the
-Mountain West
-region that takes place outside the urban core of Denver,
-South Park
-frequently features the unique culture of the region, including cattle ranchers, Old West theme parks, snowy climates, mountaineering,
-Mormons
-, real-life Colorado locations such as
-Casa Bonita
-and
-Cave of the Winds
-, and many other regionally specific characteristics.
-Stan is portrayed as an average American boy; however, he has many mishaps throughout the series. In the first 22 seasons, Stan lived in South Park, but in the episodes during and after
-season 22
-, Stan resided in Tegridy Farms. Kyle is
-Jewish
-, and his portrayal as one of the few such people in South Park is often dealt with satirically.
-[
-10
-]
-Stan is modeled after Parker, while Kyle is modeled after Stone. They are best friends, and their friendship, symbolically intended to reflect Parker and Stone's friendship,
-[
-11
-]
-is a common topic throughout the series. Cartman (as he is commonly referred to) is amoral and increasingly
-psychopathic
-, and is commonly portrayed as an
-antagonist
-. His staunch
-antisemitism
-has resulted in a progressive rivalry with Kyle.
-[
-10
-]
-[
-12
-]
-Kenny, who comes from a poor family, tightly wears his
-parka
-hood to the point where it obscures most of his face and muffles his speech. During the first five seasons, Kenny died in almost every episode before reappearing in the next with no definite explanation. He was killed off in the
-fifth season
-episode "
-Kenny Dies
-", before being reintroduced in the sixth season finale, "
-Red Sleigh Down
-". Since then, Kenny is depicted as dying sporadically. During the first 58 episodes, the children were in the
-third grade
-. During the
-fourth season
-, they entered the
-fourth grade
-, where they have remained ever since.
-[

-Plots are often set in motion by events, ranging from the fairly typical to the supernatural and extraordinary, which frequently happen in the town.
-[
-15
-]
-The boys often act as the voice of reason when these events cause panic or incongruous behavior among the adult populace, who are customarily depicted as irrational, gullible, and prone to overreaction.
-[

-]
-[
-16

-They are frequently confused by the contradictory and hypocritical behavior of their parents and other adults, and often perceive them as having distorted views on morality and society.

-]
-Early episodes tended to be
-shock value
--oriented and featured more slapstick-style humor.
-[
-33
-]
-While social
-satire
-had been used on the show occasionally earlier on, it became more prevalent as the series progressed, with the show retaining some of its focus on the boys' fondness of
-scatological humor
-in an attempt to remind adult viewers "what it was like to be eight years old".
-[
-10
-]
-Parker and Stone also began further developing other characters by giving them larger roles in certain storylines,
-[
-10
-]
-and began writing plots as parables based on religion, politics, and numerous other topics.
-[
-9
-]
-This provided the opportunity for the show to spoof both extreme sides of contentious issues,
-[
-34
-]
-while lampooning both
-liberal
-and
-conservative
-points of view.

-[

-[

-]
-Rebecca Raphael described the show as "an equal opportunity offender",
-[
-15
-]
-while Parker and Stone describe their main purpose as to "be funny" and "make people laugh",
-[
-36
-]
-[
-37
-]
-while stating that no particular topic or group of people be exempt from mockery and satire.

-[

-[

-[

-[

-]
-Parker and Stone insist that the show is still more about "kids being kids" and "what it's like to be in [elementary school] in
-America
-",
-[
-41
-]
-stating that the introduction of a more satirical element to the series was the result of the two adding more of a "moral center" to the show so that it would rely less on simply being crude and shocking in an attempt to maintain an audience.
-[
-36
-]
-[
-37
-]
-While profane, Parker notes that there is still an "underlying sweetness" aspect to the child characters,
-[
-34
-]
-and
-Time
-described the boys as "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence".
-[
-11
-]
-Usually, the boys or other characters pondered over what transpired during an episode and conveyed the important lesson taken from it with a short monologue. During earlier seasons, this speech commonly began with a variation of the phrase "You know, I've learned something today...".

-Parker and Stone met in film class at the
-University of Colorado
-in 1992 and discovered a shared love of
-Monty Python
-, which they often cite as one of their primary inspirations.
-[
-43
-]
-They created an
-animated short
-entitled
-The Spirit of Christmas
-.
-[
-27
-]
-The film was created by animating construction paper cutouts with
-stop motion
-, and features
-prototypes
-of the main characters of
-South Park
-, including a character resembling Cartman but named "Kenny", an unnamed character resembling what is today Kenny, and two near-identical unnamed characters who resemble Stan and Kyle.
-Fox Broadcasting Company
-executive and mutual friend
-Brian Graden
-commissioned Parker and Stone to create a second short film as a video Christmas card. Created in 1995, the second
-The Spirit of Christmas
-short resembled the style of the later series more closely.
-[
-44
-]
-To differentiate between the two homonymous shorts, the first short is often referred to as
-Jesus vs. Frosty
-, and the second short as
-Jesus vs. Santa
-. Graden sent copies of the video to several of his friends, and from there it was copied and distributed, including on the internet, where it became one of the first
-viral videos
-.
-[
-27
-]
-[
-11
-]
-As
-Jesus vs. Santa
-became more popular, Parker and Stone began talks of developing the short into a television series about four children residing in a fictional
-Colorado
-town in the real-life
-South Park
-basin. Fox eagerly agreed to meet with the duo about the show's premise, having prided itself on edgier products such as
-Cops
-,
-The Simpsons
-, and
-The X-Files
-. However, during the meeting at the Fox office in
-Century City
-, disagreements between the two creators and the network began to arise, mainly over the latter's refusal to air a show that included a supporting talking stool character named
-Mr. Hankey
-. Some executives at
-20th Century Fox Television
-(which was to produce the series) agreed with its then-sister network's stance on Mr. Hankey and repeatedly requested Parker and Stone to remove the character in order for the show to proceed. Refusing to meet their demands, the duo cut ties with Fox and its sister companies all together and began shopping the series somewhere else.
-[
-45
-]
-[
-46
-]
-[
-47
-]
-The two then entered negotiations with both
-MTV
-and
-Comedy Central
-. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids show.
-[
-48
-]
-When Comedy Central executive
-Doug Herzog
-watched the short, he commissioned for it to be developed into a series.
-[
-27
-]
-[
-49
-]
-Parker and Stone assembled a small staff and spent three months creating the
-pilot
-episode "
-Cartman Gets an Anal Probe
-".
-[
-50
-]
-South Park
-was in danger of being canceled before it even aired when the show fared poorly with test audiences, particularly with women. However, the shorts were still gaining more popularity over the Internet, and Comedy Central ordered a run of six episodes.
-[
-36
-]
-[
-48
-]
-South Park
-debuted with "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" on August 13, 1997.
-[
-51
-]
-Production
-Except for the pilot episode, which was produced using
-cutout animation
-, all episodes of
-South Park
-are created with the use of software, primarily
-Autodesk Maya
-.
-[
-52
-]
-As opposed to the pilot, which took three months to complete,
-[
-53
-]
-and other animated sitcoms, which are traditionally
-hand-drawn
-by companies in
-South Korea
-in a process that takes roughly eight to nine months,
-[
-27
-]
-[
-35
-]
-individual episodes of
-South Park
-take significantly less time to produce. Using computers as an animation method, the show's production staff were able to generate an episode in about three weeks during the first seasons.
-[
-54
-]
-Now, with a staff of about 70 people, episodes are typically completed in one week,
-[
-27
-]
-[
-34
-]
-[
-35
-]
-with some in as little as three to four days.
-[
-55
-]
-[
-56
-]
-[
-57
-]
-Nearly the entire production of an episode is accomplished within one set of offices, which were originally at a complex in
-Westwood, Los Angeles, California
-and are now part of South Park Studios in
-Culver City, California
-.
-[
-49
-]
-[
-53
-]
-Parker and Stone have been the show's executive producers throughout its entire history.
-[
-58
-]
-Debbie Liebling
-, who was Senior Vice President of original programming and development for Comedy Central, also served as an executive producer during the show's first five seasons, coordinating the show's production efforts between South Park Studios and Comedy Central's headquarters in New York City.
-[
-59
-]
-[
-60
-]
-During its early stages, finished episodes of
-South Park
-were hastily recorded to
-D-2
-to be sent to
-Comedy Central
-for airing in just a few days' time.
-[
-61
-]
-Each episode used to cost $250,000.
-[
-62
-]
-Writing
-The Border Patrol raid during the
-Elián González
-affair is referenced in "
-Quintuplets 2000
-", which aired within the same week the event occurred.
-Scripts are not written before a season begins.
-[
-63
-]
-Production of an episode begins on a Thursday, with the show's writing consultants
-brainstorming
-with Parker and Stone. Former staff writers include
-Pam Brady
-, who has since written scripts for the films
-Hot Rod
-,
-Hamlet 2
-and
-Team America: World Police
-(with Parker and Stone), and
-Nancy Pimental
-, who served as co-host of
-Win Ben Stein's Money
-and wrote the film
-The Sweetest Thing
-after her tenure with the show during its first three seasons.
-[
-64
-]
-[
-65
-]
-Television producer and writer
-Norman Lear
-, an idol of both Parker and Stone, served as a guest writing consultant for the
-season seven
-(2003) episodes "
-Cancelled
-" and "
-I'm a Little Bit Country
-".
-[
-63
-]
-[
-66
-]
-[
-67
-]
-During the 12th and 13th seasons,
-Saturday Night Live
-actor and writer
-Bill Hader
-served as a
-creative consultant
-and co-producer.
-[
-68
-]
-[
-69
-]
-[
-70
-]
-After exchanging ideas, Parker will write a script, and from there the entire team of animators, editors, technicians, and sound engineers will each typically work 100–120 hours in the ensuing week.
-[
-50
-]
-Since the show's
-fourth season
-(2000), Parker has assumed most of the show's directorial duties, while Stone relinquished his share of the directing to focus on handling the coordination and business aspects of the production.
-[
-27
-]
-[
-71
-]
-On Wednesday, a completed episode is sent to Comedy Central's headquarters via satellite uplink, sometimes just a few hours before its air time of 10 PM
-Eastern Time
-.
-[
-27
-]
-[
-72
-]
-Parker and Stone state that subjecting themselves to a one-week deadline creates more spontaneity amongst themselves in the creative process, which they feel results in a funnier show.
-[
-27
-]
-The schedule also allows
-South Park
-to both stay more topical and respond more quickly to specific current events than other satiric animated shows.
-[
-10
-]
-[
-73
-]
-One of the earliest examples of this was in the
-season four
-(2000) episode "
-Quintuplets 2000
-", which references the
-United States Border Patrol
-'s raid of a house during the
-Elián González affair
-, an event which occurred only four days before the episode originally aired.
-[
-74
-]
-The
-season nine
-(2005) episode "
-Best Friends Forever
-" references the
-Terri Schiavo case
-,
-[
-25
-]
-[
-34
-]
-and originally aired in the midst of the controversy and less than 12 hours before she died.
-[
-35
-]
-[
-75
-]
-A scene in the
-season seven
-(2003) finale "
-It's Christmas in Canada
-" references the discovery of dictator
-Saddam Hussein
-in a "spider hole" and his subsequent
-capture
-, which happened a mere three days prior to the episode airing.
-[
-76
-]
-The
-season 12
-(2008) episode "
-About Last Night...
-" revolves around
-Barack Obama
-'s victory in the
-2008 presidential election
-, and aired less than 24 hours after Obama was declared the winner, using segments of dialogue from Obama's real victory speech.
-[
-77
-]
-On October 16, 2013, the show failed to meet their production deadline for the first time ever, after a power outage on October 15 at the production studio prevented the episode, season 17's "
-Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers
-", from being finished in time. The episode was rescheduled to air a week later on October 23, 2013.
-[
-78
-]
-Animation
-The various stages of production (from top to bottom): the storyboard sketch, the CorelDRAW props with stock character models, and a frame from the fully rendered episode, "
-Super Fun Time
-"
-The show's style of animation is inspired by the paper cut-out cartoons made by
-Terry Gilliam
-for
-Monty Python's Flying Circus
-, of which Parker and Stone have been lifelong fans.
-[
-48
-]
-[
-11
-]
-[
-79
-]
-Construction paper
-and traditional
-stop motion
-cutout animation
-techniques were used in the original animated shorts and in the pilot episode. Subsequent episodes have been produced by
-computer animation
-, providing a similar look to the originals while requiring a fraction of the time to produce. Before computer artists begin animating an episode, a series of
-animatics
-drawn in
-Toon Boom
-are provided by the show's storyboard artists.
-[
-50
-]
-[
-80
-]
-The characters and objects are composed of simple geometrical shapes and
-primary
-and
-secondary colors
-. Most child characters are the same size and shape, and are distinguished by their clothing, hair and skin colors, and headwear.
-[
-17
-]
-Characters are mostly presented two-dimensionally and from only one angle. Their movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion, as they are purposely not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters.
-[
-10
-]
-[
-53
-]
-[
-81
-]
-Occasionally, some non-fictional characters are depicted with photographic cutouts of their actual head and face in lieu of a face reminiscent of the show's traditional style. Canadians on the show are often portrayed in an even more minimalist fashion; they have simple beady eyes, and the top halves of their heads simply flap up and down when the characters speak.
-[
-38
-]
-When the show began using computers, the cardboard cutouts were scanned and re-drawn with
-CorelDRAW
-, then imported into
-PowerAnimator
-, which was used with
-SGI
-workstations to animate the characters.
-[
-50
-]
-[
-53
-]
-The workstations were linked to a 54-processor
-render farm
-that could render 10 to 15
-shots
-an hour.
-[
-50
-]
-Beginning with
-season five
-, the animators began using
-Maya
-instead of PowerAnimator.
-[
-82
-]
-As of 2012, the studio ran a 120-processor render farm that can produce 30 or more shots an hour.
-[
-50
-]
-PowerAnimator and Maya are high-end programs mainly used for
-3D computer graphics
-, while co-producer and former animation director
-Eric Stough
-notes that PowerAnimator was initially chosen because its features helped animators retain the show's "homemade" look.
-[
-53
-]
-PowerAnimator was also used for making some of the show's visual effects,
-[
-53
-]
-which are now created using
-Motion
-,
-[
-50
-]
-a newer graphics program created by
-Apple, Inc.
-for their
-Mac OS X
-operating system
-. The show's visual quality has improved in recent seasons,
-[
-10
-]
-though several other techniques are used to intentionally preserve the cheap cutout animation look.
-[
-27
-]
-[
-54
-]
-[
-83
-]
-A few episodes feature sections of
-live-action
-footage, while others have incorporated other styles of animation. Portions of the
-season eight
-(2004) premiere "
-Good Times with Weapons
-" are done in
-anime
-style, while the
-season 10
-episode "
-Make Love, Not Warcraft
-" is done partly in
-machinima
-.
-[
-84
-]
-The
-season 12
-episode "
-Major Boobage
-", a homage to the 1981 animated film
-Heavy Metal
-, implements scenes accomplished with
-rotoscoping

-voiced the majority of the female characters until her death in November 1999.
-Mona Marshall
-and
-Eliza Schneider
-succeeded Bergman, with Schneider leaving the show after its
-seventh season
-(2003). She was replaced by
-April Stewart
-, who, along with Marshall, continues to voice most of the female characters. Bergman was originally listed in the credits under the alias Shannen Cassidy to protect her reputation as the voice of several
-Disney
-and other kid-friendly characters.
-[
-87
-]
-Stewart was originally credited under the name Gracie Lazar,
-[

-Throughout the show's run, the voices for toddler and kindergarten characters have been provided by various small children of the show's production staff.
-[
-92
-]
-When voicing child characters, the voice actors speak within their normal vocal range while adding a childlike inflection. The recorded audio is then edited with
-Pro Tools
-, and the pitch is altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth grader.
-[

-]
-[
-93
-]
-[
-94
-]
-Isaac Hayes
-voiced the character of
-Chef
-, an African-American,
-soul-singing
-cafeteria worker who was one of the few adults the boys consistently trusted.
-[
-11
-]
-[
-95
-]
-Hayes agreed to voice the character after being among Parker and Stone's ideal candidates, which also included
-Lou Rawls
-and
-Barry White
-.
-[
-96
-]
-Hayes, who lived and hosted a radio show in New York during his tenure with
-South Park
-, recorded his dialogue on a digital audio tape while a director gave directions over the phone, after which the tape would be shipped to the show's production studio in California.
-[
-53
-]
-After Hayes left the show in early 2006, the character of Chef was
-killed off
-in the
-season 10
-(2006) premiere "
-The Return of Chef
-".

-South Park
-'s earliest seasons, several high-profile celebrities inquired about guest-starring on the show. As a joke, Parker and Stone responded by offering low-profile, non-speaking roles, most of which were accepted;
-George Clooney
-provided the barks for Stan's dog Sparky in the
-season one
-(1997) episode "
-Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride
-",
-[

-Music
-Chef
-would often sing in a style reminiscent of that of his voice actor,
-Isaac Hayes
-.
-Parker says that the varying uses of music are of utmost importance to
-South Park
-.
-[
-113
-]
-Several characters often play or sing songs in order to change or influence a group's behavior, or to educate, motivate, or indoctrinate others. The show also frequently features scenes in which its characters have disapproving reactions to the performances of certain popular musicians.
-[
-113
-]
-Adam Berry
-, the show's original score composer, used
-sound synthesis
-to simulate a small orchestra, and frequently alluded to existing famous pieces of music. Berry also used signature acoustic guitar and mandolin cues as
-leitmotifs
-for the show's establishing shots.
-[
-113
-]
-[
-114
-]
-After Berry left in 2001, Jamie Dunlap and Scott Nickoley of the Los Angeles-based Mad City Production Studios provided the show's original music for the next seven seasons.
-[
-93
-]
-Since 2008, Dunlap has been credited as the show's sole score composer.
-[
-115
-]
-Dunlap's contributions to the show are one of the few that are not achieved at the show's own production offices. Dunlap reads a script, creates a score using digital audio software, and then e-mails the audio file to South Park Studios, where it is edited to fit with the completed episode.
-[
-93
-]
-In addition to singing in an effort to explain something to the children, Chef would also sing about things relevant to what had transpired in the plot. These songs were original compositions written by Parker, and they were performed by Hayes in the same sexually suggestive
-R&B
-style he had used during his own music career. The band DVDA, which consists of Parker and Stone, along with show staff members Bruce Howell and D.A. Young, performed the music for these compositions and, until the character's death on the show, were listed as "Chef's Band" in the closing credits.
-[

-Rick James
-,
-Elton John
-,
-Meat Loaf
-,
-Joe Strummer

-Ozzy Osbourne
-,
-Primus
-,

-Ween
-all guest starred and briefly performed in the
-season two
-(1998) episode "
-Chef Aid
-". Korn debuted their single "
-Falling Away from Me
-" as guest stars on the
-season three
-(1999) episode "
-Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery
-".
-[
-103
-]
-Main theme
-The show's
-theme song
-was a musical score performed by the band
-Primus
-, with the lyrics alternately sung by the band's lead singer,
-Les Claypool
-, and the show's four central characters during the opening title sequence. Kenny's muffled lines are altered after every few seasons. His lines are usually
-sexually explicit
-in nature, such as his original lines, "I like girls with big fat titties, I like girls with deep vaginas".
-[
-116
-]
-The original unaired opening composition was originally slower and had a length of 40 seconds. It was deemed too long for the opening sequence. So Parker and Stone sped it up for the show's opening, having Claypool re-record his vocals. The
-instrumental
-version of the original composition is often played during the show's closing credits.
-[
-117
-]
-The opening song played in the first four seasons (and the end credits in all seasons) has a
-folk rock
-instrumentation with
-bass guitar
-,
-trumpets
-and rhythmic drums. Its
-beat
-is fast in the opening and leisurely in the closing credits. It is in the
-minor key
-and it features a
-tritone
-or a diminished fifth, creating a melodic
-dissonance
-, which captures the show's surrealistic nature.
-[
-how?
-]
-In the latter parts of seasons 4 and 5, the opening tune has an
-electro funk
-arrangement with
-pop
-qualities. Seasons 6–9 have a sprightly
-bluegrass
-instrumentation with a usage of
-banjo
-and is set in the
-major key
-. For the later seasons, the arrangement is
-electro rock
-with a
-breakbeat
-influence, which feature
-electric guitars
-backed up by
-synthesized
-,
-groovy
-drumbeats.
-[
-93
-]
-The opening theme song has been remixed three times during the course of the series, including a remix performed by
-Paul Robb
-.
-[
-118
-]
-In 2006, the theme music was remixed with the song "Whamola" by
-Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade
-, from the album
-Purple Onion
-.

-Streaming
-In March 2008, Comedy Central made every episode of
-South Park
-available for free full-length
-on-demand
-legal streaming
-on the official South Park Studios website.
-[
-145
-]
-From March 2008 until December 2013, new episodes were added to the site the day following their debut, and an uncensored version was posted the following day. The episode stayed up for the remainder of the week, then taken down, and added to the site three weeks later.
-Within a week, the site served more than a million streams of full episodes,
-[
-145
-]
-and the number grew to 55 million by October 2008.
-[
-146
-]
-Legal issues prevent the U.S. content from being accessible outside the United States,
-[
-147
-]
-so local servers have been set up in other countries.
-[
-148
-]
-In September 2009, a South Park Studios website with streaming episodes was launched in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
-[
-149
-]
-In Canada, episodes were available for streaming from The Comedy Network's website, though due to digital rights restrictions, they are no longer available.
-[
-150
-]
-In April 2010, the season five episode "
-Super Best Friends
-" and the season fourteen episodes "
-200
-" and "
-201
-" were removed from the site; additionally, these episodes no longer air in reruns and are only available exclusively on DVD and Blu-ray. These episodes remain unavailable following the 2014 purchase by Hulu.
-In July 2014, it was announced that
-Hulu
-had signed a three-year deal purchasing exclusive online streaming rights to the
-South Park
-for a reported $80 million. Following the announcement every episode remained available for free on the South Park Studios website, using the Hulu
-player
-. As of September 2014, following the premiere of the eighteenth season, only 30 select episodes would be featured for free viewing at a time on a rotating basis on the website, with new episodes being available for an entire month starting the day following their original airings. The entire series was available on Hulu by this point.
-[
-151
-]
-As of July 2015, all episodes of
-South Park
-are available for streaming in Canada on the service
-CraveTV
-, which first consisted of seasons 1–18. Subsequent seasons were released the following July.
-[
-152
-]
-In early October 2019, industry rumors suggested that the streaming rights for
-South Park
-were being offered to various services, creating an intense bidding war that was estimated to be as high as
-US$500 million
-. HBO and South Park Digital Studios announced that HBO had secured a multi-year deal for the exclusive streaming rights for
-South Park
-on their
-HBO Max
-service starting June 24, 2020.
-[
-153
-]
-While the terms of the deal were not disclosed,
-Variety
-reported the deal fell between
-US$500 million
-and
-US$550 million
-.

-]
-Beginning with season 25 in 2022, HBO Max posts new episodes the next day after their Comedy Central airing.
-[
-155
-]
-Once that deal expires in 2025,
-Paramount+
-will become the exclusive streaming home. In addition, the season 27 episodes would stream first on Paramount+ before hitting HBO Max.
-[
-156
-]
-Though season 27 would have originally aired in 2024, the season was delayed due to what Parker and Stone claimed to be uncertainties about the
-2024 United States presidential election
-(mainly the exhaustion of
-humor set around Donald Trump
-), along with the
-proposed merger of Skydance Media and Paramount Global
-.
-[
-157
-]
-In February 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery filed a lawsuit which claimed that Paramount breached its exclusivity contract with HBO Max by airing
-South Park
-on its own streaming platform.

-Reception
-Ratings
-When
-South Park
-debuted, it was a huge ratings success for Comedy Central and is seen as being largely responsible for the success of the channel, with Herzog crediting it for putting the network "on the map".
-[
-27
-]
-[
-49
-]
-[
-164
-]
-The show's first episode, "
-Cartman Gets an Anal Probe
-", earned a
-Nielsen
-rating of 1.3 (980,000 viewers), at the time considered high for a
-cable program
-.
-[
-164
-]
-The show instantly generated buzz among television viewers, and mass viewing parties began assembling on college campuses.
-[
-21
-]
-[
-15
-]
-[
-23
-]
-By the time the eighth episode, "
-Starvin' Marvin
-", aired—three months after the show debuted—ratings and viewership had tripled, and
-South Park
-was already the most successful show in Comedy Central's history.
-[
-23
-]
-When the tenth episode "
-Damien
-" aired the following February, viewership increased another 33 percent. The episode earned a 6.4 rating, which at the time was over 10 times the average rating earned by a cable show aired in
-prime time
-.
-[
-21
-]
-[
-164
-]
-The ratings peaked with the second episode of
-season two
-, "
-Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut
-", which aired on April 22, 1998. The episode earned an 8.2 rating (6.2 million viewers) and, at the time, set a record as the highest-rated non-sports show in basic cable history.
-[

-]
-[

-]
-[
-164
-]
-During the spring of 1998, eight of the ten highest-rated shows on basic cable were
-South Park
-episodes.
-[
-22
-]
-South Park's
-second season would average a 5.8 rating (12.5 million viewers) which was a lower rating due to Comedy Central's households being much higher.
-[
-clarification needed
-]
-The success of
-South Park
-prompted more cable companies to carry Comedy Central and led it to its becoming one of the fastest-growing cable channels. The number of households that had Comedy Central jumped from 9.1 million in 1997 to 50 million in June 1998.
-[
-164
-]
-When the show debuted, the most Comedy Central had earned for a 30-second commercial was US$7,500.
-[
-21
-]
-Within a year, advertisers were paying an average of US$40,000 for 30 seconds of advertising time during airings of
-South Park
-in its second season, while some paid as much as US$80,000.
-[
-165
-]
-By the third season (1999), the series' ratings began to decrease.
-[
-166
-]
-The third-season premiere episode drew 3.4 million viewers, a dramatic drop from the 5.5 million of the previous season's premiere.
-[
-164
-]
-Stone and Parker attributed this drop in the show's ratings to the media hype that surrounded the show in the previous year, adding that the third season ratings reflected the show's "true" fan base.
-[
-164
-]
-Regardless the viewership stayed consistent with an average rating being between 3.0 (8 million viewers) to a 5.5 (17.5 million viewers). The show's ratings dropped further in its fourth season (2000), with episodes averaging just above 1.5 million viewers (though the season premiere would get 22.1 million viewers due to the hype caused by the movie). The ratings eventually increased, and seasons five through nine consistently averaged about 3 million viewers per episode.
-[
-164
-]
-Season 8's episode "Goobacks" would have
-South Park
-'s
-viewership peak at 30 million viewers. Seasons 10 to 12 would average 5 million viewers. Though its viewership is lower than it was at the height of its popularity in its earliest seasons,
-South Park
-remains one of the highest-rated series on Comedy Central.
-[
-167
-]
-The
-season 14
-(2010) premiere gained 3.7 million viewers, the show's highest-rated season premiere since 1998.
-[
-168

-In 2016, a
-New York Times
-study of the 50 TV shows with the most
-Facebook Likes
-found that "perhaps unsurprisingly, South Park ... is most popular in Colorado".

-(2005) episode "
-Trapped in the Closet
-" denounces
-Scientology
-as nothing more than "a big fat global scam",
-[
-194
-]
-while freely divulging church information that Scientology normally only reveals to members who make significant monetary contributions to the church.
-[
-204
-]
-The episode also ambiguously parodies the rumors involving the sexual orientation of Scientologist
-Tom Cruise
-, who allegedly demanded any further reruns of the episode be canceled.

-The season fourteen episodes "
-200
-" and "
-201
-" were mired in controversy for satirizing issues surrounding the depiction of the Islamic prophet,
-Muhammad
-. The website for the organization
-Revolution Muslim
-, a New York-based radical Muslim organization, posted an entry that included a warning to creators Parker and Stone that they risk violent retribution for their
-depictions of Muhammad
-. It said that they "will probably wind up like
-Theo van Gogh
-for airing this show". The posting provided the addresses to Comedy Central in New York and the production company in Los Angeles.
-[
-207
-]
-The author of the post,
-Zachary Adam Chesser
-(whose alias is Abu Talhah al-Amrikee),
-[
-208
-]
-said it was meant to serve as a warning to Parker and Stone, not a threat, and that providing the addresses was meant to give people the opportunity to protest.
-[
-209
-]
-[
-210
-]
-Despite Chesser's claims that the website entry was a warning, several media outlets and observers interpreted it as a threat.
-[
-211
-]
-[
-212
-]
-[
-213
-]
-Comedy Central censored the episode's broadcast in response, by
-bleeping out
-several speeches and covering Mohammed's appearances with a giant "censored" label.
-[
-207
-]
-Support for the episode has come in the form of
-Everybody Draw Mohammed Day
-, a movement started on Facebook that encourages people to draw Muhammad on May 20.
-[
-214
-]
-The "200" episode, which also depicted
-the Buddha
-snorting
-cocaine
-, prompted the government of
-Sri Lanka
-to ban the series outright.
-[
-215
-]
-Due to many taboo topics in China—such as
-Dalai Lama
-,
-Winnie the Pooh
-,
-[

-]
-labor camps
-,
-freedom of speech
-and
-cannabis culture
-—being involved in the
-season 23
-(2019) episode "
-Band in China
-",
-South Park
-was entirely banned in China after the episode's broadcast. The series'

-Parker and Stone issued a sarcastic apology in response.
-[
-220
-]
-[
-221
-]
-Legacy
-Cultural
-Commentary made in episodes has been interpreted as statements Parker and Stone are attempting to make to the viewing public,
-[
-222
-]
-and these opinions have been subject to much critical analysis in the media and literary world within the framework of popular philosophical, theological, social, and political concepts.
-[

-Since
-South Park
-debuted, college students have written term papers and doctoral theses analyzing the show,
-[

-while
-Brooklyn College
-offers a course called "
-South Park
-and Political Correctness".
-[

-Soon after one of Kenny's trademark deaths on the show, other characters would typically shout "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!", followed by another yelling out "You bastard(s)!"—these lines were usually said by the characters Stan and Kyle, respectively. The exclamation quickly became a popular catchphrase,
-[
-11
-]
-while the running gag of Kenny's recurring deaths is one of the more recognized hallmarks among viewers of modern television.
-[
-226
-]
-[
-227
-]
-Cartman's exclamations of "Respect my authori-tah!" and "Screw you guys ...I'm going home!" became catchphrases as well, and during the show's earlier seasons, were highly popular in the lexicon of viewers.
-[
-228
-]
-Cartman's eccentric intonation of "Hey!" was included in the 2002 edition of
-The Oxford Dictionary of Catchphrases
-.
-[
-229
-]
-In the
-season two
-episode "
-Chef Aid
-", attorney
-Johnnie Cochran
-uses what's called in the show the
-Chewbacca defense
-, which is a legal strategy that involves addressing plot holes related to
-Chewbacca
-in the film
-Return of the Jedi
-rather than discussing the trial at hand during a closing argument in a deliberate attempt to confuse jurors into thinking there is
-reasonable doubt
-. The term "Chewbacca defense" has been documented as being used by criminologists, forensic scientists, and political commentators in their various discussions of similar methods used in legal cases and public forums.

-Another season two episode, "
-Gnomes
-", revolves around a group of "underpants
-gnomes
-" who, as their name suggests, run a corporation stealing people's underpants. When asked about their business model, various gnomes reply that theirs is a three-step process: Phase 1 is "collect underpants". Phase 3 is "profit". However, the gnomes are unable to explain what is to occur between the first and final steps, and "Phase 2" is accompanied by a large question mark on their corporate flow chart. Using "????" and "PROFIT!" as the last two steps in a process (usually jokingly) became a widely popular
-Internet meme
-because of this.
-[
-232
-]
-[
-233
-]
-Especially in the context of politics and economics, "underpants gnomes" has been used by some commentators to characterize a conspicuous gap of logic or planning.

-When Sophie Rutschmann of the
-University of Strasbourg
-discovered a mutated gene that causes an adult
-fruit fly
-to die within two days after it is infected with certain bacteria, she named the gene
-kep1
-in honor of Kenny.
-[
-236
-]
-[
-237
-]
-[
-238
-]
-Similarly, when a mutated ortholog of
-KIAA1109
-was also found for said species that inhibited their ability to stand upright, walk, and caused seizures, indicative of severe neurological defects, a different set of researchers named it
-Tweek
-in honor of Tweek.

-Political
-Main article:
-South Park Republican
-While some
-conservatives
-have condemned
-South Park
-for its vulgarity, a growing population of people who hold
-center-right
-political beliefs, including teenagers and young adults, have embraced the show for its tendency to mock
-liberal
-viewpoints and lampoon liberal celebrities and icons.
-[
-240
-]
-Political commentator
-Andrew Sullivan
-dubbed the group
-South Park
-Republicans
-, or
-South Park
-conservatives.
-[
-40
-]
-[
-241
-]
-[
-242
-]
-Sullivan averred that members of the group are "extremely skeptical of political correctness but also are socially liberal on many issues", though he says the phrase applied to them is meant to be more of a casual indication of beliefs than a strong partisan label.
-[
-16
-]
-[
-40
-]
-Brian C. Anderson
-describes the group as "generally characterized by holding strong
-libertarian
-beliefs and rejecting more conservative social policy", and notes that although the show makes "wicked fun of conservatives", it is "at the forefront of a conservative revolt against liberal media" and Hollywood's "liberal hegemony".
-[
-240
-]
-[
-243
-]
-Parker and Stone reject the idea that the show has any underlying political position, and deny having a political agenda when creating an episode.
-[
-36
-]
-[
-242
-]
-[
-244
-]
-The two claim the show's higher proportion of instances lampooning liberal rather than conservative orthodoxies stems simply from their preference for making fun of liberals.
-[
-16
-]
-[
-73
-]
-While Stone has been quoted saying, "I hate conservatives, but I really fucking hate liberals", Stone and Parker have explained that their drive to lampoon a given target comes first from the target's insistence on telling other people how to behave.
-[
-195
-]
-The duo explain that they regard liberals as having both delusions of entitlement to remain free from satire, and a propensity to enforce political correctness while patronizing the citizens of
-Middle America
-.
-[
-39
-]
-[
-40
-]
-Parker and Stone are uncomfortable with the idea of themselves or
-South Park
-being assigned any kind of
-partisan
-classification.
-[
-36
-]
-[
-242
-]
-Parker said he rejects the "
-South Park
-Republican" and "
-South Park
-conservative" labels, feeling that either tag implies that one only adheres to strictly conservative or liberal viewpoints.
-[
-35
-]
-[
-240
-]
-The duo has in the past reluctantly labeled themselves libertarians and fans of
-government gridlock
-. In 2006, they said that they were "rooting for
-Hillary Clinton
-in 2008 simply because it would be weird to have her as president".

-South Park is probably the only western cartoon that can do an anime parody right
-Excluding maybe Kappa Mikey since the whole show is a parody of anime...
-First, they had Cartman gain swearing powers that were very SSJ-esque (spiky hair, menacing eyes, speedlines, SSJ aura, etc.) during his fight with Saddam Hussain then a few months later they parodied the whole Pokemon craze on the episode Chinpokomon (though it's more of a parody on the franchise as a whole but the anime was referenced). They also did the episode Good Times With Weapons which parodies/pays tribute to battle shounen anime in general with the highly-stylized anime art style and an engrish insert theme song (which is awesome):
-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VILgSsesD0
-There was also the yaoi episode with Tweek and Craig which acknowledges the show's exceptional anime fan-following and... last but not least, Princess Kenny:
-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuQfXI8c7QQ
-It's even a reference to an obscure anime Princess Lover!:
-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkf6bwudKG8
-The episode she first appeared even had the Grand Wizard King as Uncle Iroh.
-What y'all think?
-Oh and it did My Neighbor Totoro:

-Cartman's mom is named Liane after

-'s former fiancée. He caught her with another man so he named the promiscuous character after her.
-Goofs
-Exactly who is related to whom in the Marsh family is never consistent. Early episodes imply that Jimbo and Marvin (Stan's grandfather) are on Sharon's side of the family, whereas more recent ones imply they are on Randy's side. Being on Sharon's side makes sense for Jimbo, as he has a different last name. However, Marvin's last name is, indeed, confirmed to be Marsh. Matt Stone revealed in an interview that Jimbo Kerns is Randy's half-brother.
-Quotes

-: We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich for the same reason we rip on Butters for being wimpy.
-Stan
-: And we rip on Kyle for being a Jew.
-Kyle
-: And Stan for being in love with Wendy. And Cartman for being fat. And Cartman for being stupid. And Cartman for having a whore for a mom. And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole.
-Cartman
-: Hey. You did me already.
-Crazy credits

-Why I gave it a 10
-South Park Is the best TV show on Planet Earth. I actually think it's better than Rick and Morty. But, does it deserve a 10?
-When people who only watch Rick and Morty hear South Park, they think it's a very lazy and crude show (I will be ripping my friends' love for Rick and Morty to shreds). South park is actually the opposite, it is intelligent, funny and in some places heart warming and sad.
-The characters are perfect, I love Cartman, Kenny, Stan, Butters, Randy and my personal favourite Kyle. The supporting cast are some of the most memorable characters, not as good as The Simpsons.
-The episodes are some of the most memorable scenarios ever put on television. Hilarious episodes like the zip lining episode, unexpected episodes like the Christmas Critters episode, episodes exploiting people opinions and views on the world like "Chinpokemon" and "Passion of the Jew", very emotional episodes like "You're getting old" and my personal favourite episode "Raisins", very dark episodes like "Scott Tenerman must die" and the very important "Osama Bin Laden has Farty Pants". There's such a variety than Peter Griffin doing something stupid or a wacky Sci-Fi adventure with Rick and Morty.
-The show has fallen. It's now a very boring show. But, instead of looking at the present, we have seasons 1-17 to rewatch. I have many respects to Stone and Parker for giving us a show that even my mother can love.

-How South Park Was Born: An Oral History of 'The Spirit of Christmas' | Longform - EW.com
-How ‘South Park’ was born
-An oral history of ‘The Spirit of Christmas’
-by James Hibberd
-It’s the video that went viral before going viral was a thing: Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s “The Spirit of Christmas,” two raunchy animated shorts created with construction-paper cutouts that led to Comedy Central’s
-South Park
-. Here’s the story of how a pre-YouTube sensationâand the 18-year-old hitâwere born.
-Trey Parker:
-Matt and I were at the University of Colorado at Boulder [in 1992]. When youâre in the film school, you’re working on someoneâs film every weekend, so you’re spending your weekends on set. Matt and I would always end up either running cameras or running sound or something. Shoots are so f--king boring, and we would just sit there doing voices for each otherâthat’s where it actually started. We would always talk like these little kids and make each other laugh. So we had a year of doing little skits with the voices before we shot anything. The film department showed student films at the end of the semester. I was like, “There should be something Christmassy,” because these screenings were a few days before Christmas. I had done one even before that, called
-American History
-, with construction paper cutouts, and I got a student award for it. So Matt and I just did this little Jesus and Frosty thing.
-“Jesus vs. Frosty,” a.k.a. the first “Spirit of Christmas,” had many elements that would later define South Parkâfoulmouthed, crudely animated Colorado kids who become embroiled in a satirical, absurd battle with outside forces.
-Parker:
-[The audience reaction] was huge. It was just the fact that there were little-kid voices and cute animation and that they were screaming, “F---!” People hadn’t really seen anything like that before. It was mostly college kids so we knew our audience. At the time, we were just trying to do something that all our friends and college buddies would think was funny.
-After college, Parker and Stone moved to L.A. in 1993 and met Fox exec Brian Graden at a screening of their indie film
-Cannibal! The Musical
-. The trio began collaborating on various projects and they showed him “Jesus vs. Frosty.”
-Parker:
-Brian was like, “Show me everything youâve done,” and we’re like, “Well, here’s this cartoon we made.” Brian totally loved it, and he’s like, “Can I send [this as] a Christmas card to everyone?” So he sent it to a production house and copied it a hundred times onto VHS tapes we’re just like, “Oh, that’s so cool.” He sent it to his friends. They loved that so much that the next year Brian said, “Can you make another one?”
-Producer Brian Graden:
-There was no calculation that millions of people would see this and then we’d get a TV series. I wanted to do something cool for the Christmas card, and those guys are geniuses. We’d first seen their movie about cannibalism [
-Cannibal! The Musical
-], the Alfred Packer movie. They way they used pauses and their rhythms of comedy were so observational and genius. That was the first thing we saw, and [we] just got to know them, and they would do various projects. We did a kids’ pilot, if you can believe it, for Fox’s sister network. We had started developing
-South Park
-based on those characters before [the second video] was made.
-Parker:
-He gave us, like, $2,000. We were so stoked. It was all single-cel animation, so the damn thing took a week of no sleep to make five minutes’ worth. We had talked about if it could ever be a show, and that’s why at the very beginning of “The Spirit of Christmas” we put the sign that said “South Park” in it. It was just in the back of our minds. We didn’t even put our names on it because we thought, “Oh, this is just a thing we’re making.”
-Parker and Stone’s second “Spirit of Christmas” video, 1995’s “Jesus vs. Santa,” was more polished than their first and skewered the traditional religion-versus-commercialism holiday debate. Not putting their names on the video caused some major issues, but what happened next had never quite happened before or since.
-Parker:
-The whole thing went viral before anyone really even knew what viral meant. Brian’s friends loved it so much that they were copying VHS-to-VHS and then giving it to friends. We heard a rumor that George Clooney has had it copied like 300 times. Then months went by. And then we were at a party and these guys were like, “You guys have got to see this!” They made everyone gather around the TV and played “The Spirit of Christmas.” Matt and I are like, “Dude, we made that.” And they’re like, “No, we know the guys that made this â and they just got a meeting with MTV.” We’re like,
-“What?!”
-Brian went to MTV and said, “No, no, these are the guys who made it.” And then we were like talking to people in New York and they were like, “You’ve got to see this Christmas thing.” We’re like, “Dude, we made that!” It was the most surreal thing. We were at bars trying to pick up girls and being like, “We’re the guys that made ‘The Spirit of Christmas.’” We were kind of like little rock stars.
-Suddenly every network and studio wanted to meet Parker and Stone. Along with Graden, they pitched a series version of
-South Park
-. But most executives were skeptical the underground VHS sensation could work as a weekly show.
-Graden:
-When I got to know Trey, it became clear he had worlds in his head. And this was a world, if not fully developed, that was in his imagination and was based in large part on being a boy growing up in snowy Colorado. With any great artist or writer, you want them to be able to express what’s most natural and real to them. This was not Trey’s literal life story, but he knew this worldâand animation was a great way to leverage that.
-Parker:
-We were [broke and] splitting money for a donut. Everyone wanted to meet us. [But executives] were saying, “You could never repeat this as a TV show, because you couldn’t be this dirty on TV and so it wouldn’t be funny.” We started coming up with the idea of Mr. Garrison and Mr. Mackey and we had drawings of them, and they’re like, “It’ll never work because adults don’t want to watch a show about kids. They want to watch a show about a family.” We knew it wouldn’t have to be this dirty to be funny; you just have to push the envelope. Plus, we thought there was more to it than that.
-Graden:
-MTV turned us down. Fox had no interest in it. Others turned us down...
-Parker:
-All I knew [was] that this dumb little thing we made, people were somehow getting it from a friend of a friend and copying it. People would have these VHS copies where you could barely see the picture because it had been copied 400 times. We were just like, “We should not give up on this idea, because for people to work that hard to copy something and get it to their friends meant something.”
-Then-Comedy Central president Doug Herzog:
-[Development executive] Debbie Liebling dragged me into a conference room and said, “You’ve got to watch this.” I thought that it was the funniest thing that I ever saw. Then I said, “I don’t know if we can put that on TV, but we need to be in business with this guy.”
-Graden:
-People don’t remember this, but Comedy Central was this tiny also-ran channel without much original contentâcertainly nothing scripted that I remember. But being the show that can put a channel on the map is a much more fun position to be in than hoping you can hold onto 100 percent of a lead-in from
-Married with Children

-Herzog:
-We fly them to New York for some meetings. They were just young guys. I was like, “So, hey, are you going back to L.A.?” They’re like, “No, we’re staying the weekend.” I was like, “Oh, I go can we get you some dinner reservations? Or get you to some clubs? Or maybe some concert tickets?” They were like, “No, we’re good. We’re all set.” And Trey is like, “We’re going to see
-Cats
-on Friday night, and we’re going to see
-Les Miz
-on Saturday night, and we’re going to see
-Phantom of the Opera
-on Sunday afternoon.” And because I didn’t really know them and they were just these wild, crazy, young guys, I was like, “Wait, wait,
-what?
-” And they were like, “Yeah, we love Broadway.” I swear, at the time I thought they were f--king with me.

-Parker:
-Finally, Comedy Central was like, “Well, make a pilot.”
-Herzog:
-I do remember the first stupid thing I said to them. They said we’re going to kill Kenny every week. And I remember going, “Wait, is that funny? Like, won’t people hate that? Isn’t that sad?” And I just shut up and let them continue. The brilliance of
-South Park
-is there’s nothing conventional about it.
-Parker and Stone hand-crafted the
-South Park
-pilot, provocatively titled “Cartman Gets an Anal Probe”â¦
-Herzog:
-They made a pilot, and we were a little disappointed. And we expressed that.
-Graden:
-We went to do a focus group. They were asked to rate the pilot on a scale of 1 to 10. There were 1s, and 2s, and 3s everywhere. We made three people cryâthey were saying that it’s inappropriate for children to say those kinds of things. Matt and Trey asked how it went. I had been to many focus groups, but they had not. I’ve never seen a worse focus group, and thought, “Well, this show isn’t going to be the next year of my life.”
-At a meeting with Comedy Central after the focus group, Parker, Stone and Graden all wore T-shirts with a “check” symbol and a “minus” symbol on them.
-Graden:
-We went in as Team Check Minus. That was the grade we received from the focus group. In grade school, when they were politically correct, they wouldn't give you an “F.” They would give you a check minus. I think they thought it was funny. Comedy Central wanted them to change the pilot’s ending. Since this was being done by construction paper by hand and every frame had to be shot, just 30 seconds of a change would lead to six more nights of them cutting out construction paper, making shapes and moving them around. Re-doing the ending was a tremendous amount of effort for them.
-Herzog:
-They went back in and made some adjustments and sort of redid some things. Then it became the stone-cold classic it is today.
-Comedy Central decided to move forward with a series, despite the focus group scores.
-Graden:
-That takes more bravery than people know until they’ve had those jobs.
-Herzog:
-Anybody that tells you they knew it was going to be a hitâand the only people I would believe if they said that would be Matt and Treyâthat’s just bullshit. Nobody knows, right? What we did know was it was really funny. We thought it was clever. And for a network that was still struggling to reach 50 million homes, we went, “At the very least this will get attention.” But then I bolted up in bed just nights before we put it on the air, in cold sweat, I swear to God. I was like, “Wait, can I get
-arrested
-for this? Is this legal?” The big thing at the time on cable was was how HBO would show some breasts on
-Dream On
-. You have to remember how far the culture has come, and how far the needle has moved in a good part of 20 years. There was nothing on TV like this. I don’t think anybody understood how funny, how smart, how ingenious it was going to actually be.
-In 1997,
-South Park
-debuted to nearly a million viewersâconsidered huge at the time for basic cable, especially for Comedy Centralâand its ratings quickly grew. That climbing viewership seemed almost inexplicable.
-Herzog:
-I came from MTV, and
-South Park
-took off quicker, faster, and with more impact than any sort of rock band or music act that I’d ever seen. It took off like a rocket. And it got an immediate, incredible critical response.
-Graden:
-The only thing we could figure is that tons of college kids had gone to the library and had watched “The Spirit of Christmas” over and over [online]. Five weeks later, I remember walking in New York and seeing Matt and Trey on the cover of
-Newsweek
-âand trying to process how this happened.
-Parker:
-The Internet was starting to become a thing that people were catching on to, and it was this marketing tool for the first time. “Spirit of Christmas,” because it’s so shitty looking in the first place, is something that worked really well on the Internet because you could download it quick and it can look like shit and it’s okay. That’s part of why it was able to be viral on VHS even though it would degradeâthe whole part of the joke of it was how shitty it looked. We got so lucky. Still, to this day, every stranger that walks up to me usually says, “I have your original tape.” People come up to me all the time and they’re like, “You know, I had one of the original ‘Spirit of Christmas’ VHS’s.” And I always say, “Oh, wow, that’s cool.” And in my head I’m thinking, “Dude, do you know how many people tell me that?”

-South Park is VERY different from other adult cartoons and cartoons in general
-I remember back in the 90s, a lot of Conservative Christians disliked the show but seems like in recent years, this has changed.
-Thanks to episodes like Red Hot Catholic Love, Board Girls and the entirety of Season 19, a lot of Conservatives grew to like this show due to the shameless liberal bashing, which is weird considering that most adult cartoons tend to be strictly left leaning, including Family Guy.
-South Park is a very apathetic show, everyone is an asshole, even the good guys like Kyle are sometimes meant to be in the wrong, the show attacks both sides but the politically correct side is the one that gets the most hate and is often but not always demonized and portrayed as being just as bad if worse than the alt right.
-This is very ironic to me because when i first got into the show, i thought South Park was just yet another liberal adult cartoon like The Simpsons and Family Guy but throughout the years, i grew up to be more of a left leaning feminist and i noticed how the show is different from other cartoons because it doesn’t try to pander to progressives all the time and is very offensive if conservative with its morals in a funny way but sometimes it can be tiresome.
-South Park IS different from other cartoons, it’s conservative but not in a way that is extremely fundamentalist and the show may mock both sides but the left is more bashed than the right.
-Before you accuse me of being a man hating feminist or downvote this post for supposedly calling South Park alt right propaganda, I’m just pointing out how South Park is not like any other cartoon in existence and that’s what make it unique.
