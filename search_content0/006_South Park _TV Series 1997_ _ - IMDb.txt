Trivia
Cartman's mom is named Liane after
Trey Parker
's former fiancée. He caught her with another man so he named the promiscuous character after her.
Goofs
Exactly who is related to whom in the Marsh family is never consistent. Early episodes imply that Jimbo and Marvin (Stan's grandfather) are on Sharon's side of the family, whereas more recent ones imply they are on Randy's side. Being on Sharon's side makes sense for Jimbo, as he has a different last name. However, Marvin's last name is, indeed, confirmed to be Marsh. Matt Stone revealed in an interview that Jimbo Kerns is Randy's half-brother.
Quotes
Kyle
: We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich for the same reason we rip on Butters for being wimpy.
Stan
: And we rip on Kyle for being a Jew.
Kyle
: And Stan for being in love with Wendy. And Cartman for being fat. And Cartman for being stupid. And Cartman for having a whore for a mom. And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole.
Cartman
: Hey. You did me already.
Crazy credits
This warning appears at the beginning of every episode:
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW--EVEN THOSE BASED ON REAL PEOPLE--ARE ENTIRELY FICTIONAL. ALL CELEBRITY VOICES ARE IMPERSONATED...POORLY. THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM CONTAINS COARSE
LANGUAGE AND DUE TO ITS CONTENT IT SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED BY ANYONE.
Alternate versions
On the "South Park" official site, modern reruns and the Blu-Ray releases, the show has been transformed from its 1.33:1 original aspect ratio to 1.78:1. Presenting new background with new sides on the screen and new restoration.

Why I gave it a 10
South Park Is the best TV show on Planet Earth. I actually think it's better than Rick and Morty. But, does it deserve a 10?
When people who only watch Rick and Morty hear South Park, they think it's a very lazy and crude show (I will be ripping my friends' love for Rick and Morty to shreds). South park is actually the opposite, it is intelligent, funny and in some places heart warming and sad.
The characters are perfect, I love Cartman, Kenny, Stan, Butters, Randy and my personal favourite Kyle. The supporting cast are some of the most memorable characters, not as good as The Simpsons.
The episodes are some of the most memorable scenarios ever put on television. Hilarious episodes like the zip lining episode, unexpected episodes like the Christmas Critters episode, episodes exploiting people opinions and views on the world like "Chinpokemon" and "Passion of the Jew", very emotional episodes like "You're getting old" and my personal favourite episode "Raisins", very dark episodes like "Scott Tenerman must die" and the very important "Osama Bin Laden has Farty Pants". There's such a variety than Peter Griffin doing something stupid or a wacky Sci-Fi adventure with Rick and Morty.
The show has fallen. It's now a very boring show. But, instead of looking at the present, we have seasons 1-17 to rewatch. I have many respects to Stone and Parker for giving us a show that even my mother can love.
