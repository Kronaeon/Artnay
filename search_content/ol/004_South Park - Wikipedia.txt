The Spirit of Christmas
South Park
is an American
animated sitcom
created by
Trey Parker
and
Matt Stone
, and developed by
Brian Graden
for
Comedy Central
. The series revolves around four boys—
Stan Marsh
,
Kyle Broflovski
,
Eric Cartman
, and
Kenny McCormick
—and their exploits in and around the titular
Colorado
town.
South Park
also features many recurring characters. The series became infamous for its
profanity
and
dark
,
surreal humor
that
satirizes
a
large range of subject matter
.
Parker and Stone developed
South Park
from two animated short films, both titled
The Spirit of Christmas
, released in 1992 and 1995. The second short became one of the first
viral
Internet videos, leading to the series' production. The
pilot episode
was produced using
cutout animation
; the remainder of the series uses
computer animation
recalling the prior technique. Since the fourth season, episodes have generally been written and produced during the week preceding their broadcast, with Parker serving as the lead writer and director.
Since its debut on August 13, 1997,
328 episodes
of
South Park
have been broadcast. It debuted with great success, consistently earning the highest ratings of any basic cable program. Subsequent ratings have varied, but it remains one of Comedy Central's longest-running programs. In August 2021,
South Park
was renewed through 2027, and a series of television specials was announced for
Paramount+
, the first two of which were released later that year.

In October 2019, it was announced that
WarnerMedia
had acquired exclusive streaming rights to
South Park
starting in June 2020 for
HBO Max
.
[

]
The series' twenty-seventh season will premiere on July 9, 2025.
[
5
]
South Park
has received critical acclaim, and is included in various publications' lists of the greatest television shows. It has received numerous accolades, including five
Primetime Emmy Awards
and a
Peabody Award
. A theatrical film,
South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut
, was released in June 1999 to commercial and critical success, garnering an
Academy Award
nomination. In 2013,
TV Guide
ranked
South Park
the tenth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.

Premise
Setting and characters
Main article:
List of
South Park
characters
South Park
centers around four boys:
Stan Marsh
,
Kyle Broflovski
,
Eric Cartman
and
Kenny McCormick
. The boys live in the
fictional small town
of South Park, located within the real-life
South Park basin
in the
Rocky Mountains
of central
Colorado
,
[
7
]
approximately a one-hour drive from
Denver
.
[
8
]
The town is also home to an assortment of other characters, including
students
,
families
,
elementary school staff
, and other
various residents
.
[
9
]
Prominent settings include South Park Elementary, various neighborhoods and the surrounding mountain range, actual Colorado landmarks, and the businesses along the town's main street, all of which are based on the appearance of similar locations in
Fairplay, Colorado
.
[
7
]
[
9
]
As one of the few television programs set in the
Mountain West
region that takes place outside the urban core of Denver,
South Park
frequently features the unique culture of the region, including cattle ranchers, Old West theme parks, snowy climates, mountaineering,
Mormons
, real-life Colorado locations such as
Casa Bonita
and
Cave of the Winds
, and many other regionally specific characteristics.
Stan is portrayed as an average American boy; however, he has many mishaps throughout the series. In the first 22 seasons, Stan lived in South Park, but in the episodes during and after
season 22
, Stan resided in Tegridy Farms. Kyle is
Jewish
, and his portrayal as one of the few such people in South Park is often dealt with satirically.
[
10
]
Stan is modeled after Parker, while Kyle is modeled after Stone. They are best friends, and their friendship, symbolically intended to reflect Parker and Stone's friendship,
[
11
]
is a common topic throughout the series. Cartman (as he is commonly referred to) is amoral and increasingly
psychopathic
, and is commonly portrayed as an
antagonist
. His staunch
antisemitism
has resulted in a progressive rivalry with Kyle.
[
10
]
[
12
]
Kenny, who comes from a poor family, tightly wears his
parka
hood to the point where it obscures most of his face and muffles his speech. During the first five seasons, Kenny died in almost every episode before reappearing in the next with no definite explanation. He was killed off in the
fifth season
episode "
Kenny Dies
", before being reintroduced in the sixth season finale, "
Red Sleigh Down
". Since then, Kenny is depicted as dying sporadically. During the first 58 episodes, the children were in the
third grade
. During the
fourth season
, they entered the
fourth grade
, where they have remained ever since.
[
13
]
[
14
]
Plots are often set in motion by events, ranging from the fairly typical to the supernatural and extraordinary, which frequently happen in the town.
[
15
]
The boys often act as the voice of reason when these events cause panic or incongruous behavior among the adult populace, who are customarily depicted as irrational, gullible, and prone to overreaction.
[
7
]
[
16
]
They are frequently confused by the contradictory and hypocritical behavior of their parents and other adults, and often perceive them as having distorted views on morality and society.

Themes and style

Subject matter in
South Park
Each episode opens with a
tongue-in-cheek
all persons fictitious disclaimer
: "All characters and events in this show—even those based on real people—are entirely fictional. All celebrity voices are impersonated.....poorly. The following program contains coarse language and due to its content it should not be viewed by anyone."
[

]
[

]
South Park
was the first weekly program to be rated
TV-MA
,
[
20
]
and is generally intended for adult audiences.
[
21
]
[
22
]
[
23
]
The boys and most other child characters use strong profanity, with only the most taboo words being
bleeped
during a typical broadcast.
[
9
]
Parker and Stone perceive this as the manner in which real-life small boys speak when they are alone.
[

[

South Park
commonly makes use of
carnivalesque
and
absurdist
techniques,
[

numerous
running gags
,
[

[

]
sexual content
,
[
30
]
[
31
]
offhand pop-cultural references, and satirical portrayal of celebrities.
[
32
]
Early episodes tended to be
shock value
-oriented and featured more slapstick-style humor.
[
33
]
While social
satire
had been used on the show occasionally earlier on, it became more prevalent as the series progressed, with the show retaining some of its focus on the boys' fondness of
scatological humor
in an attempt to remind adult viewers "what it was like to be eight years old".
[
10
]
Parker and Stone also began further developing other characters by giving them larger roles in certain storylines,
[
10
]
and began writing plots as parables based on religion, politics, and numerous other topics.
[
9
]
This provided the opportunity for the show to spoof both extreme sides of contentious issues,
[
34
]
while lampooning both
liberal
and
conservative
points of view.
[
9
]
[
16
]
[
35
]
Rebecca Raphael described the show as "an equal opportunity offender",
[
15
]
while Parker and Stone describe their main purpose as to "be funny" and "make people laugh",
[
36
]
[
37
]
while stating that no particular topic or group of people be exempt from mockery and satire.
[
16
]
[
32
]
[
38
]
[
39
]
[
40
]
Parker and Stone insist that the show is still more about "kids being kids" and "what it's like to be in [elementary school] in
America
",
[
41
]
stating that the introduction of a more satirical element to the series was the result of the two adding more of a "moral center" to the show so that it would rely less on simply being crude and shocking in an attempt to maintain an audience.
[
36
]
[
37
]
While profane, Parker notes that there is still an "underlying sweetness" aspect to the child characters,
[
34
]
and
Time
described the boys as "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence".
[
11
]
Usually, the boys or other characters pondered over what transpired during an episode and conveyed the important lesson taken from it with a short monologue. During earlier seasons, this speech commonly began with a variation of the phrase "You know, I've learned something today...".
[
42
]
Development
South Park
creators
Trey Parker
(left) and
Matt Stone
continue to do most of the writing, directing and voice acting on the show.
Parker and Stone met in film class at the
University of Colorado
in 1992 and discovered a shared love of
Monty Python
, which they often cite as one of their primary inspirations.
[
43
]
They created an
animated short
entitled
The Spirit of Christmas
.
[
27
]
The film was created by animating construction paper cutouts with
stop motion
, and features
prototypes
of the main characters of
South Park
, including a character resembling Cartman but named "Kenny", an unnamed character resembling what is today Kenny, and two near-identical unnamed characters who resemble Stan and Kyle.
Fox Broadcasting Company
executive and mutual friend
Brian Graden
commissioned Parker and Stone to create a second short film as a video Christmas card. Created in 1995, the second
The Spirit of Christmas
short resembled the style of the later series more closely.
[
44
]
To differentiate between the two homonymous shorts, the first short is often referred to as
Jesus vs. Frosty
, and the second short as
Jesus vs. Santa
. Graden sent copies of the video to several of his friends, and from there it was copied and distributed, including on the internet, where it became one of the first
viral videos
.
[
27
]
[
11
]
As
Jesus vs. Santa
became more popular, Parker and Stone began talks of developing the short into a television series about four children residing in a fictional
Colorado
town in the real-life
South Park
basin. Fox eagerly agreed to meet with the duo about the show's premise, having prided itself on edgier products such as
Cops
,
The Simpsons
, and
The X-Files
. However, during the meeting at the Fox office in
Century City
, disagreements between the two creators and the network began to arise, mainly over the latter's refusal to air a show that included a supporting talking stool character named
Mr. Hankey
. Some executives at
20th Century Fox Television
(which was to produce the series) agreed with its then-sister network's stance on Mr. Hankey and repeatedly requested Parker and Stone to remove the character in order for the show to proceed. Refusing to meet their demands, the duo cut ties with Fox and its sister companies all together and began shopping the series somewhere else.
[
45
]
[
46
]
[
47
]
The two then entered negotiations with both
MTV
and
Comedy Central
. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids show.
[
48
]
When Comedy Central executive
Doug Herzog
watched the short, he commissioned for it to be developed into a series.
[
27
]
[
49
]
Parker and Stone assembled a small staff and spent three months creating the
pilot
episode "
Cartman Gets an Anal Probe
".
[
50
]
South Park
was in danger of being canceled before it even aired when the show fared poorly with test audiences, particularly with women. However, the shorts were still gaining more popularity over the Internet, and Comedy Central ordered a run of six episodes.
[
36
]
[
48
]
South Park
debuted with "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" on August 13, 1997.
[
51
]
Production
Except for the pilot episode, which was produced using
cutout animation
, all episodes of
South Park
are created with the use of software, primarily
Autodesk Maya
.
[
52
]
As opposed to the pilot, which took three months to complete,
[
53
]
and other animated sitcoms, which are traditionally
hand-drawn
by companies in
South Korea
in a process that takes roughly eight to nine months,
[
27
]
[
35
]
individual episodes of
South Park
take significantly less time to produce. Using computers as an animation method, the show's production staff were able to generate an episode in about three weeks during the first seasons.
[
54
]
Now, with a staff of about 70 people, episodes are typically completed in one week,
[
27
]
[
34
]
[
35
]
with some in as little as three to four days.
[
55
]
[
56
]
[
57
]
Nearly the entire production of an episode is accomplished within one set of offices, which were originally at a complex in
Westwood, Los Angeles, California
and are now part of South Park Studios in
Culver City, California
.
[
49
]
[
53
]
Parker and Stone have been the show's executive producers throughout its entire history.
[
58
]
Debbie Liebling
, who was Senior Vice President of original programming and development for Comedy Central, also served as an executive producer during the show's first five seasons, coordinating the show's production efforts between South Park Studios and Comedy Central's headquarters in New York City.
[
59
]
[
60
]
During its early stages, finished episodes of
South Park
were hastily recorded to
D-2
to be sent to
Comedy Central
for airing in just a few days' time.
[
61
]
Each episode used to cost $250,000.
[
62
]
Writing
The Border Patrol raid during the
Elián González
affair is referenced in "
Quintuplets 2000
", which aired within the same week the event occurred.
Scripts are not written before a season begins.
[
63
]
Production of an episode begins on a Thursday, with the show's writing consultants
brainstorming
with Parker and Stone. Former staff writers include
Pam Brady
, who has since written scripts for the films
Hot Rod
,
Hamlet 2
and
Team America: World Police
(with Parker and Stone), and
Nancy Pimental
, who served as co-host of
Win Ben Stein's Money
and wrote the film
The Sweetest Thing
after her tenure with the show during its first three seasons.
[
64
]
[
65
]
Television producer and writer
Norman Lear
, an idol of both Parker and Stone, served as a guest writing consultant for the
season seven
(2003) episodes "
Cancelled
" and "
I'm a Little Bit Country
".
[
63
]
[
66
]
[
67
]
During the 12th and 13th seasons,
Saturday Night Live
actor and writer
Bill Hader
served as a
creative consultant
and co-producer.
[
68
]
[
69
]
[
70
]
After exchanging ideas, Parker will write a script, and from there the entire team of animators, editors, technicians, and sound engineers will each typically work 100–120 hours in the ensuing week.
[
50
]
Since the show's
fourth season
(2000), Parker has assumed most of the show's directorial duties, while Stone relinquished his share of the directing to focus on handling the coordination and business aspects of the production.
[
27
]
[
71
]
On Wednesday, a completed episode is sent to Comedy Central's headquarters via satellite uplink, sometimes just a few hours before its air time of 10 PM
Eastern Time
.
[
27
]
[
72
]
Parker and Stone state that subjecting themselves to a one-week deadline creates more spontaneity amongst themselves in the creative process, which they feel results in a funnier show.
[
27
]
The schedule also allows
South Park
to both stay more topical and respond more quickly to specific current events than other satiric animated shows.
[
10
]
[
73
]
One of the earliest examples of this was in the
season four
(2000) episode "
Quintuplets 2000
", which references the
United States Border Patrol
's raid of a house during the
Elián González affair
, an event which occurred only four days before the episode originally aired.
[
74
]
The
season nine
(2005) episode "
Best Friends Forever
" references the
Terri Schiavo case
,
[
25
]
[
34
]
and originally aired in the midst of the controversy and less than 12 hours before she died.
[
35
]
[
75
]
A scene in the
season seven
(2003) finale "
It's Christmas in Canada
" references the discovery of dictator
Saddam Hussein
in a "spider hole" and his subsequent
capture
, which happened a mere three days prior to the episode airing.
[
76
]
The
season 12
(2008) episode "
About Last Night...
" revolves around
Barack Obama
's victory in the
2008 presidential election
, and aired less than 24 hours after Obama was declared the winner, using segments of dialogue from Obama's real victory speech.
[
77
]
On October 16, 2013, the show failed to meet their production deadline for the first time ever, after a power outage on October 15 at the production studio prevented the episode, season 17's "
Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers
", from being finished in time. The episode was rescheduled to air a week later on October 23, 2013.
[
78
]
Animation
The various stages of production (from top to bottom): the storyboard sketch, the CorelDRAW props with stock character models, and a frame from the fully rendered episode, "
Super Fun Time
"
The show's style of animation is inspired by the paper cut-out cartoons made by
Terry Gilliam
for
Monty Python's Flying Circus
, of which Parker and Stone have been lifelong fans.
[
48
]
[
11
]
[
79
]
Construction paper
and traditional
stop motion
cutout animation
techniques were used in the original animated shorts and in the pilot episode. Subsequent episodes have been produced by
computer animation
, providing a similar look to the originals while requiring a fraction of the time to produce. Before computer artists begin animating an episode, a series of
animatics
drawn in
Toon Boom
are provided by the show's storyboard artists.
[
50
]
[
80
]
The characters and objects are composed of simple geometrical shapes and
primary
and
secondary colors
. Most child characters are the same size and shape, and are distinguished by their clothing, hair and skin colors, and headwear.
[
17
]
Characters are mostly presented two-dimensionally and from only one angle. Their movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion, as they are purposely not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters.
[
10
]
[
53
]
[
81
]
Occasionally, some non-fictional characters are depicted with photographic cutouts of their actual head and face in lieu of a face reminiscent of the show's traditional style. Canadians on the show are often portrayed in an even more minimalist fashion; they have simple beady eyes, and the top halves of their heads simply flap up and down when the characters speak.
[
38
]
When the show began using computers, the cardboard cutouts were scanned and re-drawn with
CorelDRAW
, then imported into
PowerAnimator
, which was used with
SGI
workstations to animate the characters.
[
50
]
[
53
]
The workstations were linked to a 54-processor
render farm
that could render 10 to 15
shots
an hour.
[
50
]
Beginning with
season five
, the animators began using
Maya
instead of PowerAnimator.
[
82
]
As of 2012, the studio ran a 120-processor render farm that can produce 30 or more shots an hour.
[
50
]
PowerAnimator and Maya are high-end programs mainly used for
3D computer graphics
, while co-producer and former animation director
Eric Stough
notes that PowerAnimator was initially chosen because its features helped animators retain the show's "homemade" look.
[
53
]
PowerAnimator was also used for making some of the show's visual effects,
[
53
]
which are now created using
Motion
,
[
50
]
a newer graphics program created by
Apple, Inc.
for their
Mac OS X
operating system
. The show's visual quality has improved in recent seasons,
[
10
]
though several other techniques are used to intentionally preserve the cheap cutout animation look.
[
27
]
[
54
]
[
83
]
A few episodes feature sections of
live-action
footage, while others have incorporated other styles of animation. Portions of the
season eight
(2004) premiere "
Good Times with Weapons
" are done in
anime
style, while the
season 10
episode "
Make Love, Not Warcraft
" is done partly in
machinima
.
[
84
]
The
season 12
episode "
Major Boobage
", a homage to the 1981 animated film
Heavy Metal
, implements scenes accomplished with
rotoscoping
.

Eliza Schneider
succeeded Bergman, with Schneider leaving the show after its
seventh season
(2003). She was replaced by
April Stewart
, who, along with Marshall, continues to voice most of the female characters. Bergman was originally listed in the credits under the alias Shannen Cassidy to protect her reputation as the voice of several
Disney

Mr. Garrison
.
[
91
]
Throughout the show's run, the voices for toddler and kindergarten characters have been provided by various small children of the show's production staff.
[
92
]
When voicing child characters, the voice actors speak within their normal vocal range while adding a childlike inflection. The recorded audio is then edited with
Pro Tools
, and the pitch is altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth grader.
[

]
[
93
]
[

Isaac Hayes
voiced the character of
Chef
, an African-American,
soul-singing
cafeteria worker who was one of the few adults the boys consistently trusted.
[
11

[

]
Hayes agreed to voice the character after being among Parker and Stone's ideal candidates, which also included
Lou Rawls
and
Barry White
.
[
96
]
Hayes, who lived and hosted a radio show in New York during his tenure with
South Park
, recorded his dialogue on a digital audio tape while a director gave directions over the phone, after which the tape would be shipped to the show's production studio in California.
[

After Hayes left the show in early 2006, the character of Chef was
killed off
in the
season 10
(2006) premiere "
The Return of Chef

have guest starred as other speaking characters. During
South Park
's earliest seasons, several high-profile celebrities inquired about guest-starring on the show. As a joke, Parker and Stone responded by offering low-profile, non-speaking roles, most of which were accepted;
George Clooney
provided the barks for Stan's dog Sparky in the
season one
(1997) episode "
Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride
",
[
110
]
Leno provided the meows for Cartman's cat in the season one finale "
Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut
",
[
110
]
and
Henry Winkler
voiced the various growls and grunts of a kid-eating monster in the
season two
(1998) episode "
City on the Edge of Forever
".
[
111
]
Jerry Seinfeld
offered to lend his voice for the
Thanksgiving
episode "
Starvin' Marvin
", but declined to appear when he was only offered a role as "Turkey #2".
[
112
]
Music
Chef
would often sing in a style reminiscent of that of his voice actor,
Isaac Hayes
.
Parker says that the varying uses of music are of utmost importance to
South Park
.
[
113
]
Several characters often play or sing songs in order to change or influence a group's behavior, or to educate, motivate, or indoctrinate others. The show also frequently features scenes in which its characters have disapproving reactions to the performances of certain popular musicians.
[
113
]
Adam Berry
, the show's original score composer, used
sound synthesis
to simulate a small orchestra, and frequently alluded to existing famous pieces of music. Berry also used signature acoustic guitar and mandolin cues as
leitmotifs
for the show's establishing shots.
[
113
]
[
114
]
After Berry left in 2001, Jamie Dunlap and Scott Nickoley of the Los Angeles-based Mad City Production Studios provided the show's original music for the next seven seasons.
[
93
]
Since 2008, Dunlap has been credited as the show's sole score composer.
[
115
]
Dunlap's contributions to the show are one of the few that are not achieved at the show's own production offices. Dunlap reads a script, creates a score using digital audio software, and then e-mails the audio file to South Park Studios, where it is edited to fit with the completed episode.
[
93
]
In addition to singing in an effort to explain something to the children, Chef would also sing about things relevant to what had transpired in the plot. These songs were original compositions written by Parker, and they were performed by Hayes in the same sexually suggestive
R&B
style he had used during his own music career. The band DVDA, which consists of Parker and Stone, along with show staff members Bruce Howell and D.A. Young, performed the music for these compositions and, until the character's death on the show, were listed as "Chef's Band" in the closing credits.

Rick James
,
Elton John
,
Meat Loaf
,
Joe Strummer
,
Ozzy Osbourne
,
Primus
,
Rancid
, and
Ween
all guest starred and briefly performed in the
season two
(1998) episode "
Chef Aid
". Korn debuted their single "
Falling Away from Me
" as guest stars on the
season three
(1999) episode "
Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery
".
[
103
]
Main theme
The show's
theme song
was a musical score performed by the band
Primus
, with the lyrics alternately sung by the band's lead singer,
Les Claypool
, and the show's four central characters during the opening title sequence. Kenny's muffled lines are altered after every few seasons. His lines are usually
sexually explicit
in nature, such as his original lines, "I like girls with big fat titties, I like girls with deep vaginas".
[
116
]
The original unaired opening composition was originally slower and had a length of 40 seconds. It was deemed too long for the opening sequence. So Parker and Stone sped it up for the show's opening, having Claypool re-record his vocals. The
instrumental
version of the original composition is often played during the show's closing credits.
[
117
]
The opening song played in the first four seasons (and the end credits in all seasons) has a
folk rock
instrumentation with
bass guitar
,
trumpets
and rhythmic drums. Its
beat
is fast in the opening and leisurely in the closing credits. It is in the
minor key
and it features a
tritone
or a diminished fifth, creating a melodic
dissonance
, which captures the show's surrealistic nature.
[
how?
]
In the latter parts of seasons 4 and 5, the opening tune has an
electro funk
arrangement with
pop
qualities. Seasons 6–9 have a sprightly
bluegrass
instrumentation with a usage of
banjo
and is set in the
major key
. For the later seasons, the arrangement is
electro rock
with a
breakbeat
influence, which feature
electric guitars
backed up by
synthesized
,
groovy
drumbeats.
[
93
]
The opening theme song has been remixed three times during the course of the series, including a remix performed by
Paul Robb
.
[
118
]
In 2006, the theme music was remixed with the song "Whamola" by
Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade
, from the album
Purple Onion
.

In distribution deals with Comedy Central, other independent networks also broadcast the series in other international markets. In Australia, the show is broadcast on
The Comedy Channel
,
Comedy Central
and
free-to-air
channel
SBS Viceland
(before 2009), while new episodes aired on

. The program also airs free-to-air in Australia on
10 Shake
, a sister network to Comedy Central through Paramount.
[
122

The series is broadcast uncensored in Canada in English on
The Comedy Network
[
123
]
and, later,
Much
. The series was formerly broadcast on
Global

Syndication
Broadcast syndication
rights to
South Park
were acquired by
Debmar-Mercury
and
Tribune Entertainment
in 2003 and 2004 respectively.
[
129
]
[
130
]
Episodes further edited for content began running in syndication on September 19, 2005, and were aired in the United States with the
TV-14
rating.
[
130
]
[
131
]
20th Television
replaced Tribune as co-distributor in early 2008. By the time its run in syndication ended in 2015,
[
132
]
it aired in 90 percent of the television markets across the United States and Canada, where it generated an estimated US$25 million a year in advertising revenue.
[
133
]
[
134
]
In 2019,
CBS Television Distribution
(the syndication arm of ViacomCBS, now known as
Paramount Global
), took over the full distribution rights following the
acquisition
of
21st Century Fox
(parent of 20th Television) by
The Walt Disney Company
(who had employed Debmar-Mercury founder Mort Marcus as the head of their
syndication division
), distributing the show in syndication.
[
135
]
In 2021, South Park Studios struck a deal with
ViacomCBS
, which allows the show to be renewed all the way up to season 30 and 14 additional films, enough to carry the show to at least 2027.

List of South Park home video releases
Complete seasons of
South Park
have been regularly released in their entirety on DVD since 2002, with
season twenty-six
being the most recently released. Several other themed DVD compilations have been released by
Rhino Entertainment
and Comedy Central,
[
138
]
while the three-episode
Imaginationland
story arc
was reissued
straight-to-DVD
as a full-length feature in 2008.
[
139
]
[
140
]
[
141
]
Blu-ray
releases started in 2008 with the release of
season twelve
.
[
142
]
Subsequent seasons have been released in this format alongside the longer-running DVD releases. The first eleven seasons were released on Blu-ray for the first time in December 2017.
[
143
]
[
144
]
Streaming
In March 2008, Comedy Central made every episode of
South Park
available for free full-length
on-demand
legal streaming
on the official South Park Studios website.
[
145
]
From March 2008 until December 2013, new episodes were added to the site the day following their debut, and an uncensored version was posted the following day. The episode stayed up for the remainder of the week, then taken down, and added to the site three weeks later.
Within a week, the site served more than a million streams of full episodes,
[
145
]
and the number grew to 55 million by October 2008.
[
146
]
Legal issues prevent the U.S. content from being accessible outside the United States,
[
147
]
so local servers have been set up in other countries.
[
148
]
In September 2009, a South Park Studios website with streaming episodes was launched in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
[
149
]
In Canada, episodes were available for streaming from The Comedy Network's website, though due to digital rights restrictions, they are no longer available.
[
150
]
In April 2010, the season five episode "
Super Best Friends
" and the season fourteen episodes "
200
" and "
201
" were removed from the site; additionally, these episodes no longer air in reruns and are only available exclusively on DVD and Blu-ray. These episodes remain unavailable following the 2014 purchase by Hulu.
In July 2014, it was announced that
Hulu
had signed a three-year deal purchasing exclusive online streaming rights to the
South Park
for a reported $80 million. Following the announcement every episode remained available for free on the South Park Studios website, using the Hulu
player
. As of September 2014, following the premiere of the eighteenth season, only 30 select episodes would be featured for free viewing at a time on a rotating basis on the website, with new episodes being available for an entire month starting the day following their original airings. The entire series was available on Hulu by this point.
[
151
]
As of July 2015, all episodes of
South Park
are available for streaming in Canada on the service
CraveTV
, which first consisted of seasons 1–18. Subsequent seasons were released the following July.
[
152
]
In early October 2019, industry rumors suggested that the streaming rights for
South Park
were being offered to various services, creating an intense bidding war that was estimated to be as high as
US$500 million
. HBO and South Park Digital Studios announced that HBO had secured a multi-year deal for the exclusive streaming rights for
South Park
on their
HBO Max
service starting June 24, 2020.
[
153
]
While the terms of the deal were not disclosed,
Variety
reported the deal fell between
US$500 million
and
US$550 million
.
[
154
]
Beginning with season 25 in 2022, HBO Max posts new episodes the next day after their Comedy Central airing.
[
155
]
Once that deal expires in 2025,
Paramount+
will become the exclusive streaming home. In addition, the season 27 episodes would stream first on Paramount+ before hitting HBO Max.
[
156
]
Though season 27 would have originally aired in 2024, the season was delayed due to what Parker and Stone claimed to be uncertainties about the
2024 United States presidential election
(mainly the exhaustion of
humor set around Donald Trump
), along with the
proposed merger of Skydance Media and Paramount Global
.
[
157
]
In February 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery filed a lawsuit which claimed that Paramount breached its exclusivity contract with HBO Max by airing
South Park
on its own streaming platform.
[
158
]
Re-rendered episodes
From its debut in 1997 to the
season twelve finale
in 2008 the series had been originally produced in
standard definition
, with a
4:3
aspect ratio
. In 2009, the series switched to being produced in
16:9
high definition
1080p
with the beginning of the
thirteenth season
.
[
159
]
Since this, all twelve seasons originally produced in standard definition have been
remastered
by South Park Studios, being fully
re-rendered
in high definition. The aspect ratio of these episodes were also converted from 4:3 to 16:9 as well.
[
159
]
The re-rendered versions were also released on Blu-ray. Several of the re-rendered episodes from the earlier seasons have their original uncensored audio tracks; they had previously been released in censored form.
[
159
]
[
160
]
[
161
]
[
162
]
The fifth-season episode "
Super Best Friends
", which was pulled from syndication and online streams following the
controversy surrounding episode "201"
, was not released alongside the rest of the season when it was released in HD on iTunes in 2011. The episode was later re-rendered and made available for the Blu-ray release of the season that was released on December 5, 2017.
[
143
]
The episode is presented in its original presentation, without Muhammad's image being obscured as in later episodes of the series.
[
163

Reception
Ratings
When
South Park
debuted, it was a huge ratings success for Comedy Central and is seen as being largely responsible for the success of the channel, with Herzog crediting it for putting the network "on the map".
[
27
]
[
49
]
[
164
]
The show's first episode, "
Cartman Gets an Anal Probe
", earned a
Nielsen
rating of 1.3 (980,000 viewers), at the time considered high for a
cable program
.
[
164
]
The show instantly generated buzz among television viewers, and mass viewing parties began assembling on college campuses.
[
21
]
[
15
]
[
23
]
By the time the eighth episode, "
Starvin' Marvin
", aired—three months after the show debuted—ratings and viewership had tripled, and
South Park
was already the most successful show in Comedy Central's history.
[
23
]
When the tenth episode "
Damien
" aired the following February, viewership increased another 33 percent. The episode earned a 6.4 rating, which at the time was over 10 times the average rating earned by a cable show aired in
prime time
.
[
21
]
[
164
]
The ratings peaked with the second episode of
season two
, "
Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut
", which aired on April 22, 1998. The episode earned an 8.2 rating (6.2 million viewers) and, at the time, set a record as the highest-rated non-sports show in basic cable history.
[
29
]
[
37
]
[
164
]
During the spring of 1998, eight of the ten highest-rated shows on basic cable were
South Park
episodes.
[
22
]
South Park's
second season would average a 5.8 rating (12.5 million viewers) which was a lower rating due to Comedy Central's households being much higher.
[
clarification needed
]
The success of
South Park
prompted more cable companies to carry Comedy Central and led it to its becoming one of the fastest-growing cable channels. The number of households that had Comedy Central jumped from 9.1 million in 1997 to 50 million in June 1998.
[
164
]
When the show debuted, the most Comedy Central had earned for a 30-second commercial was US$7,500.
[
21
]
Within a year, advertisers were paying an average of US$40,000 for 30 seconds of advertising time during airings of
South Park
in its second season, while some paid as much as US$80,000.
[
165
]
By the third season (1999), the series' ratings began to decrease.
[
166
]
The third-season premiere episode drew 3.4 million viewers, a dramatic drop from the 5.5 million of the previous season's premiere.
[
164
]
Stone and Parker attributed this drop in the show's ratings to the media hype that surrounded the show in the previous year, adding that the third season ratings reflected the show's "true" fan base.
[
164
]
Regardless the viewership stayed consistent with an average rating being between 3.0 (8 million viewers) to a 5.5 (17.5 million viewers). The show's ratings dropped further in its fourth season (2000), with episodes averaging just above 1.5 million viewers (though the season premiere would get 22.1 million viewers due to the hype caused by the movie). The ratings eventually increased, and seasons five through nine consistently averaged about 3 million viewers per episode.
[
164
]
Season 8's episode "Goobacks" would have
South Park
's
viewership peak at 30 million viewers. Seasons 10 to 12 would average 5 million viewers. Though its viewership is lower than it was at the height of its popularity in its earliest seasons,
South Park
remains one of the highest-rated series on Comedy Central.
[
167
]
The
season 14
(2010) premiere gained 3.7 million viewers, the show's highest-rated season premiere since 1998.
[
168
]
In 2016, a
New York Times
study of the 50 TV shows with the most
Facebook Likes
found that "perhaps unsurprisingly, South Park ... is most popular in Colorado".
[
169
]
Subsequent seasons saw substantially lower ratings, with season 25 averaging 0.65 million viewers an episode.

Criticism
The show's frequent depiction of
taboo
subject matter, general toilet humor, accessibility to younger viewers, disregard for
conservative
sensibilities, negative depiction of
liberal
causes, and portrayal of religion for comic effect have generated controversy and debate over the course of its run.
[

As the series became popular, students in two schools were barred from wearing
South Park
-related T-shirts,
[
18
]
[
22
]
[
32
]
and the headmaster of a
UK public school
asked parents not to let their children watch the programme after eight- and nine-year-old children voted the
South Park
character Cartman as their favorite personality in a 1999 poll.
[
190
]
Parker and Stone assert that the show is not meant to be viewed by young children, and the show is certified with TV ratings that indicate its intention for mature audiences.
[
22
]
In 1999, they went on record to cancel the release of the
Game Boy Color
game based on the series, as Parker and Stone determined that a game based on an adult animated series would be inappropriate for a console whose core demographic consisted of children.
[
191
]
Parents Television Council
founder
L. Brent Bozell III
and
Action for Children's Television
founder
Peggy Charren
have both condemned the show, with the latter claiming it is "dangerous to the democracy".

Several other activist groups have protested the show's parodies of
Christianity
and portrayal of
Jesus Christ
.
[
18
]
[
194
]
Stone has stated that parents who disapprove of
South Park
for its portrayal of how kids behave are upset because they "have an idyllic vision of what kids are like", adding "[kids] don't have any kind of social tact or etiquette, they're just complete little raging bastards".

Controversies
Main article:
South Park
controversies
The show further lampooned the controversy surrounding its use of profanity, as well as the media attention surrounding the network show
Chicago Hope
's singular use of the word
shit
, with the
season five
premiere "
It Hits the Fan
",
[
195
]
in which the word
shit
is said 162 times without being bleeped for censorship purposes, while also appearing uncensored in written form.
[
37
]
In the days following the show's original airing, 5,000 disapproving e-mails were sent to Comedy Central.
[
48
]
Despite its 43 uncensored uses of the racial slur
nigger
, the
season 11
episode "
With Apologies to Jesse Jackson
" generated relatively little controversy, as most in the black community and the
NAACP
praised the episode for its context and its comedic way of conveying other races' perceptions of how black people feel when hearing the word.
[
196
]
[
197
]
Specific controversies regarding the show have included an
April Fools' Day
prank played on its viewers in 1998,
[
198
]
its depiction of the
Virgin Mary
in the
season nine
(2005) finale "
Bloody Mary
" that angered several
Catholics
,
[
35
]
its depiction of
Steve Irwin
with a
stingray
barb stuck in his chest in the episode "
Hell on Earth 2006
", which originally aired less than two months after Irwin was killed in the same fashion,
[
199
]
[
200
]
Comedy Central's censorship of the depiction of
Muhammad
in the
season 10
episode "
Cartoon Wars Part II
" in the wake of the
Jyllands-Posten
Muhammad cartoons controversy
[
194
]
and consistent mockery of the concept of
climate change
by using
climate change denialist
talking points.
[
201
]
[
202
]
[
203
]
The
season nine
(2005) episode "
Trapped in the Closet
" denounces
Scientology
as nothing more than "a big fat global scam",
[
194
]
while freely divulging church information that Scientology normally only reveals to members who make significant monetary contributions to the church.
[
204
]
The episode also ambiguously parodies the rumors involving the sexual orientation of Scientologist
Tom Cruise
, who allegedly demanded any further reruns of the episode be canceled.
[
199
]
[
205
]
Isaac Hayes
, a Scientologist, later quit
South Park
because of his objection to the episode.
[
206
]
The season fourteen episodes "
200
" and "
201
" were mired in controversy for satirizing issues surrounding the depiction of the Islamic prophet,
Muhammad
. The website for the organization
Revolution Muslim
, a New York-based radical Muslim organization, posted an entry that included a warning to creators Parker and Stone that they risk violent retribution for their
depictions of Muhammad
. It said that they "will probably wind up like
Theo van Gogh
for airing this show". The posting provided the addresses to Comedy Central in New York and the production company in Los Angeles.
[
207
]
The author of the post,
Zachary Adam Chesser
(whose alias is Abu Talhah al-Amrikee),
[
208
]
said it was meant to serve as a warning to Parker and Stone, not a threat, and that providing the addresses was meant to give people the opportunity to protest.
[
209
]
[
210
]
Despite Chesser's claims that the website entry was a warning, several media outlets and observers interpreted it as a threat.
[
211
]
[
212
]
[
213
]
Comedy Central censored the episode's broadcast in response, by
bleeping out
several speeches and covering Mohammed's appearances with a giant "censored" label.
[
207
]
Support for the episode has come in the form of
Everybody Draw Mohammed Day
, a movement started on Facebook that encourages people to draw Muhammad on May 20.
[
214
]
The "200" episode, which also depicted
the Buddha
snorting
cocaine
, prompted the government of
Sri Lanka
to ban the series outright.
[
215
]
Due to many taboo topics in China—such as
Dalai Lama
,
Winnie the Pooh
,
[
216
]
labor camps
,
freedom of speech
and
cannabis culture
—being involved in the
season 23
(2019) episode "
Band in China

South Park
was entirely banned in China after the episode's broadcast. The series'
Baidu Baike
article,
Baidu Tieba
forum,
Douban
page,
Zhihu
page and
Bilibili
videos have been deleted or inaccessible to the public, all related keywords and topics have been prohibited from being searched and discussed on China-based search engines and social media sites including

and on

public platforms.

Parker and Stone issued a sarcastic apology in response.
[
220
]
[
221
]
Legacy
Cultural
Commentary made in episodes has been interpreted as statements Parker and Stone are attempting to make to the viewing public,
[
222
]
and these opinions have been subject to much critical analysis in the media and literary world within the framework of popular philosophical, theological, social, and political concepts.
[
26
]
[
222
]
[
223
]
Since
South Park
debuted, college students have written term papers and doctoral theses analyzing the show,
[
55
]
while
Brooklyn College
offers a course called "
South Park
and Political Correctness".
[
224
]
[
225
]
Soon after one of Kenny's trademark deaths on the show, other characters would typically shout "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!", followed by another yelling out "You bastard(s)!"—these lines were usually said by the characters Stan and Kyle, respectively. The exclamation quickly became a popular catchphrase,
[
11
]
while the running gag of Kenny's recurring deaths is one of the more recognized hallmarks among viewers of modern television.
[
226
]
[
227
]
Cartman's exclamations of "Respect my authori-tah!" and "Screw you guys ...I'm going home!" became catchphrases as well, and during the show's earlier seasons, were highly popular in the lexicon of viewers.
[
228
]
Cartman's eccentric intonation of "Hey!" was included in the 2002 edition of
The Oxford Dictionary of Catchphrases
.
[
229
]
In the
season two
episode "
Chef Aid
", attorney
Johnnie Cochran
uses what's called in the show the
Chewbacca defense
, which is a legal strategy that involves addressing plot holes related to
Chewbacca
in the film
Return of the Jedi
rather than discussing the trial at hand during a closing argument in a deliberate attempt to confuse jurors into thinking there is
reasonable doubt
. The term "Chewbacca defense" has been documented as being used by criminologists, forensic scientists, and political commentators in their various discussions of similar methods used in legal cases and public forums.
[
230
]
[
231
]
Another season two episode, "
Gnomes
", revolves around a group of "underpants
gnomes
" who, as their name suggests, run a corporation stealing people's underpants. When asked about their business model, various gnomes reply that theirs is a three-step process: Phase 1 is "collect underpants". Phase 3 is "profit". However, the gnomes are unable to explain what is to occur between the first and final steps, and "Phase 2" is accompanied by a large question mark on their corporate flow chart. Using "????" and "PROFIT!" as the last two steps in a process (usually jokingly) became a widely popular
Internet meme
because of this.
[
232
]
[
233
]
Especially in the context of politics and economics, "underpants gnomes" has been used by some commentators to characterize a conspicuous gap of logic or planning.
[
234

[

When Sophie Rutschmann of the
University of Strasbourg
discovered a mutated gene that causes an adult
fruit fly
to die within two days after it is infected with certain bacteria, she named the gene
kep1
in honor of Kenny.
[
236
]
[
237
]
[
238
]
Similarly, when a mutated ortholog of
KIAA1109
was also found for said species that inhibited their ability to stand upright, walk, and caused seizures, indicative of severe neurological defects, a different set of researchers named it
Tweek
in honor of Tweek.
[
239
]
Political
Main article:
South Park Republican
While some
conservatives
have condemned
South Park
for its vulgarity, a growing population of people who hold
center-right
political beliefs, including teenagers and young adults, have embraced the show for its tendency to mock
liberal
viewpoints and lampoon liberal celebrities and icons.
[
240
]
Political commentator
Andrew Sullivan
dubbed the group
South Park
Republicans
, or
South Park
conservatives.
[
40
]
[
241
]
[
242
]
Sullivan averred that members of the group are "extremely skeptical of political correctness but also are socially liberal on many issues", though he says the phrase applied to them is meant to be more of a casual indication of beliefs than a strong partisan label.
[
16
]
[
40
]
Brian C. Anderson
describes the group as "generally characterized by holding strong
libertarian
beliefs and rejecting more conservative social policy", and notes that although the show makes "wicked fun of conservatives", it is "at the forefront of a conservative revolt against liberal media" and Hollywood's "liberal hegemony".
[
240
]
[
243
]
Parker and Stone reject the idea that the show has any underlying political position, and deny having a political agenda when creating an episode.
[
36
]
[
242
]
[
244
]
The two claim the show's higher proportion of instances lampooning liberal rather than conservative orthodoxies stems simply from their preference for making fun of liberals.
[
16
]
[
73
]
While Stone has been quoted saying, "I hate conservatives, but I really fucking hate liberals", Stone and Parker have explained that their drive to lampoon a given target comes first from the target's insistence on telling other people how to behave.
[
195
]
The duo explain that they regard liberals as having both delusions of entitlement to remain free from satire, and a propensity to enforce political correctness while patronizing the citizens of
Middle America
.
[
39
]
[
40
]
Parker and Stone are uncomfortable with the idea of themselves or
South Park
being assigned any kind of
partisan
classification.
[
36
]
[
242
]
Parker said he rejects the "
South Park
Republican" and "
South Park
conservative" labels, feeling that either tag implies that one only adheres to strictly conservative or liberal viewpoints.
[
35
]
[
240
]
The duo has in the past reluctantly labeled themselves libertarians and fans of
government gridlock
. In 2006, they said that they were "rooting for
Hillary Clinton
in 2008 simply because it would be weird to have her as president".
