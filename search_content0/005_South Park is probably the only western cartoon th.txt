South Park is probably the only western cartoon that can do an anime parody right
Excluding maybe Kappa Mikey since the whole show is a parody of anime...
First, they had Cartman gain swearing powers that were very SSJ-esque (spiky hair, menacing eyes, speedlines, SSJ aura, etc.) during his fight with Saddam Hussain then a few months later they parodied the whole Pokemon craze on the episode Chinpokomon (though it's more of a parody on the franchise as a whole but the anime was referenced). They also did the episode Good Times With Weapons which parodies/pays tribute to battle shounen anime in general with the highly-stylized anime art style and an engrish insert theme song (which is awesome):

There was also the yaoi episode with Tweek and Craig which acknowledges the show's exceptional anime fan-following and... last but not least, Princess Kenny:

It's even a reference to an obscure anime Princess Lover!:

The episode she first appeared even had the Grand Wizard King as Uncle Iroh.
What y'all think?
Oh and it did My Neighbor Totoro:
