Item was described as "New" and "open box" but was missing the Basic User Guide which was listed on the packaging as being supplied. Being an open-box item, I understand why this could be missing but it would have been nice if that info had appeared in the online item description...I was able to get a more-detailed electronic version online.
Dealing with supplier was great experience and he provided quick feedback to address my concerns. Item actually arrived sooner than initially stated!

Unfortunately the item came in wrecked but that wasn't the sellers intentions. The communication was good when I notified them and eBay money back guarantee took action after filling a report. The only advice I'd pass to the seller is better packaging when sending certain items. I recommend the seller tho! Thanks
